0	The Woman on Platform 8	The Woman on Platform 8It was my second year at boarding-school, and I was sitting on platform no. 8 atAmbala station, waiting for the northern bound train. I think I was about twelve atthe time. My parents considered me old enough to travel alone, and I had arrived bybus at Ambala early in the evening: now there was a wait till midnight before mytrain arrived. Most of the time I had been pacing up and down the platform,browsing at the book-stall, or feeding broken biscuits to stray dogs; trains came andwent, and the platform would be quiet for a while and then, when a train arrived, itwould be an inferno of heaving, shouting, agitated human bodies. As the carriagedoors opened, a tide of people would sweep down upon the nervous little ticket-collector at the gate; and every time this happened I would be caught in the rush andswept outside the station. Now tired of this game and of ambling about the platform,I sat down on my suitcase and gazed dismally across the railway-tracks.Trolleys rolled past me, and I was conscious of the cries of the various vendors— the men who sold curds and lemon, the sweet-meat-seller, the newspaper boy —but I had lost interest in all that went on along the busy platform, and continued tostare across the railway-tracks, feeling bored and a little lonely.‘Are you all alone, my son?’ asked a soft voice close behind me.I looked up and saw a woman standing near me. She was leaning over, and I saw apale face, and dark kind eyes. She wore no jewels, and was dressed very simply in awhite sari.‘Yes, I am going to school,’ I said, and stood up respectfully; she seemed poor,but there was a dignity about her that commanded respect.‘I have been watching you for some time,’ she said. ‘Didn’t your parents come tosee you off?’‘I don’t live here,’ I said. ‘I had to change trains. Anyway, I can travel alone.’‘I am sure you can,’ she said, and I liked her for saying that, and I also liked herfor the simplicity of her dress, and for her deep, soft voice and the serenity of her face.‘Tell me, what is your name?’ she asked.‘Arun,’ I said.‘And how long do you have to wait for your train?’‘About an hour, I think. It comes at twelve o’clock.’‘Then come with me and have something to eat.’I was going to refuse, out of shyness and suspicion, but she took me by the hand,and then I felt it would be silly to pull my hand away. She told a coolie to look aftermy suitcase, and then she led me away down the platform. Her hand was gentle, andshe held mine neither too firmly nor too lightly. I looked up at her again. She wasnot young. And she was not old. She must have been over thirty but, had she beenfifty, I think she would have looked much the same.She took me into the station dining-room, ordered tea and samosas and jalebies,and at once I began to thaw and take a new interest in this kind woman. The strangeencounter had little effect on my appetite. I was a hungry school boy, and I ate asmuch as I could in as polite a manner as possible. She took obvious pleasure inwatching me eat, and I think it was the food that strengthened the bond between usand cemented our friendship, for under the influence of the tea and sweets I began totalk quite freely, and told her about my school, my friends, my likes and dislikes.She questioned me quietly from time to time, but preferred listening; she drew meout very well, and I had soon forgotten that we were strangers. But she did not askme about my family or where I lived, and I did not ask her where she lived. Iaccepted her for what she had been to me — a quiet, kind and gentle woman whogave sweets to a lonely boy on a railway platform ...After about half-an-hour we left the dining-room and began walking back alongthe platform. An engine was shunting up and down beside platform No. 8, and as itapproached, a boy leapt off the platform and ran across the rails, taking a short cutto the next platform. He was at a safe distance from the engine, and there was nodanger unless he had fallen; but as he leapt across the rails, the woman clutched myarm. Her fingers dug into my flesh, and I winced with pain. I caught her fingers andlooked up at her, and I saw a spasm of pain and fear and sadness pass across herface. She watched the boy as he climbed other platform, and it was not until he haddisappeared in the crowd that she relaxed her hold on my arm. She smiled at mereassuringly, and took my hand again: but her fingers trembled against mine.‘He was all right,’ I said, feeling that it was she who needed reassurance. She smiled gratefully at me and pressed my hand. We walked together in silenceuntil we reached the place where I had left my suitcase, one of my schoolfellows,Satish, a boy of about my age, had turned up with his mother.‘Hello, Arun!’ he called. ‘The train’s coming in late, as usual. Did you know wehave a new Headmaster this year?’We shook hands, and then he turned to his mother and said: ‘This is Arun, mother.He is one of my friends, and the best bowler in the class.’‘I am glad to know that,’ said his mother, a large imposing woman who worespectacles. She looked at the woman who led my hand and said: ‘And I supposeyou’re Arun’s mother?’I opened my mouth to make some explanation, but before I could say anything thewoman replied: ‘Yes, I am Arun’s mother.’I was unable to speak a word. I looked quickly up at the woman, but she did notappear to be at all embarrassed, and was smiling at Satish’s mother.Satish’s mother said: ‘It’s such a nuisance having to wait for the train right in themiddle of the night. But one can’t let the child wait here alone. Anything can happento a boy at a big station like this, there are so many suspicious characters hangingabout. These days one has to be very careful of strangers.’‘Arun can travel alone though,’ said the woman beside me, and somehow I feltgrateful to her for saying that. I had already forgiven her for lying: and besides, Ihad taken an instinctive dislike to Satish’s mother.‘Well, be very careful Arun,’ said Satish’s mother looking sternly at me throughher spectacles. ‘Be very careful when your mother is not with you. And never talk tostrangers!’I looked from Satish’s mother to the woman who had given me tea and sweets,and then back at Satish’s mother.‘I like strangers,’ I said.Satish’s mother definitely staggered a little, as obviously she was not used tobeing contradicted by small boys. ‘There you are, you see! If you don’t watch overthem all the time, they’ll walk straight into trouble. Always listen to what yourmother tells you,’ she said, wagging a fat little finger at me. ‘And never, never talkto strangers.’I glared resentfully at her, and moved closer to the woman who had befriendedme. Satish was standing behind his mother, grinning at me, and delighting in myclash with his mother. Apparently he was on my side. The station bell clanged, and the people who had till now been squattingresignedly on the platform began bustling about.‘Here it comes,’ shouted Satish, as the engine whistle shrieked and the front lightsplayed over the rails.The train moved slowly into the station, the engine hissing and sending out wavesof steam. As it came to a stop, Satish jumped on the footboard of a lightedcompartment and shouted, ‘Come on, Arun, this one’s empty!’ and I picked up mysuitcase and made a dash for the open door.We placed ourselves at the open windows, and the two women stood outside onthe platform, talking up to us. Satish’s mother did most of the talking.‘Now don’t jump on and off moving trains, as you did just now,’ she said. ‘Anddon’t stick your heads out of the windows, and don’t eat any rubbish on the way.’She allowed me to share the benefit of her advice, as she probably didn’t think my‘mother’ a very capable person. She handed Satish a bag of fruit, a cricket bat and abig box of chocolates, and told him to share the food with me. Then she stood backfrom the window to watch how my ‘mother’ behaved.I was smarting under the patronising tone of Satish’s mother, who obviouslythought mine a very poor family: and I did not intend giving the other woman away.I let her take my hand in hers, but I could think of nothing to say. I was conscious ofSatish’s mother staring at us with hard, beady eyes, and I found myself hating herwith a firm, unreasoning hate. The guard walked up the platform, blowing hiswhistle for the train to leave. I looked straight into the eyes of the woman who heldmy hand, and she smiled in a gentle, understanding way. I leaned out of the windowthen, and put my lips to her cheek, and kissed her.The carriage jolted forward, and she drew her hand away.‘Good-bye, mother!’ said Satish, as the train began to move slowly out of thestation. Satish and his mother waved to each other.‘Good-bye,’ I said to the other woman, ‘good-bye — mother ...’I didn’t wave or shout, but sat still in front of the window, gazing at the woman onthe platform. Satish’s mother was talking to her, but she didn’t appear to belistening; she was looking at me, as the train took me away. She stood there on thebusy platform, a pale sweet woman in white, and I watched her until she was lost inthe milling crowd.	aakankshaduggal745@gmail.com	2018		RH
1	The Coral Tree	The night had been hot, the rain frequent, and I slept on the verandah instead of inthe house. I was in my twenties and I had begun to earn a living and felt I had certainresponsibilities. In a short while a tonga would take me to a railway station, andfrom there a train would take me to Bombay, and then a ship would take me toEngland. There would be work, interviews, a job, a different kind of life; so manythings, that this small bungalow of my grandfather’s would be remembered fitfully,in rare moments of reflection.When I awoke on the verandah I saw a grey morning, smelt the rain on the redearth, and remembered that I had to go away. A girl was standing in the verandahporch, looking at me very seriously. When I saw her, I sat up in bed with a start.She was a small, dark girl, her eyes big and black, her pigtails tied up in a brightred ribbon; and she was fresh and clean like the rain and the red earth.She stood looking at me, and she was very serious.‘Hullo,’ I said, smiling, trying to put her at ease.But the girl was business-like. She acknowledged my greeting with a brief nod.‘Can I do anything for you?’ I asked, stretching my limbs. ‘Do you stay nearhere?’She nodded again.‘With your parents?’With great assurance she said, ‘Yes. But I can stay on my own.’‘You’re like me,’ I said, and for a while I forgot about being an old man oftwenty. ‘I like to do on my own. I’m going away today.’‘Oh,’ she said, a little breathlessly.‘Would you care to go to England?’ ‘I want to go everywhere,’ she said, ‘ToAmerica and Africa and Japan and Honolulu.’‘Maybe you will,’ I said. ‘I’m going everywhere, and no one can stop me ... Butwhat is it you want? What did you come for?’‘I want some flowers but I can’t reach them.’ She waved her hand towards thegarden. ‘That tree, see?’The coral tree stood in front of the house surrounded by pools of water andbroken, fallen blossoms. The branches of the tree were thick with the scarlet, pea-shaped flowers.‘All right,’ I said. ‘Just let me get ready.’The tree was easy to climb, and I made myself comfortable on one of the lowerbranches, smiling down at the serious upturned face of the girl.‘I’ll throw them down to you,’ I said.I bent a branch but the wood was young and green, and I had to twist it severaltimes before it snapped.‘I’m not sure that I ought to do this,’ I said, as I dropped the flowering branch tothe girl.‘Don’t worry,’ she said.‘Well, if you’re ready to speak up for me —’‘Don’t worry.’I felt a sudden nostalgic longing for childhood and an urge to remain behind inmy grandfather’s house with its tangled memories and ghosts of yesteryear. But Iwas the only one left, and what could I do except climb coral and jack-fruit trees?‘Have you many friends?’ I asked.‘Oh, yes.’‘Who is the best?’‘The cook. He lets me stay in the kitchen, which is more interesting than thehouse. And I like to watch him cooking. And he gives me things to eat, and tells mestories ...’‘And who is your second best friend?’She inclined her head to one side, and thought very hard.‘I’ll make you the second best,’ she said.I sprinkled coral-blossoms over her head. ‘That’s very kind of you. I’m happy tobe your second best.’A tonga-bell sounded at the gate, and I looked out from the tree and said, ‘It’scome for me. I have to go now.’I climbed down.‘Will you help me with my suitcases?’ I asked, as we walked together towards theverandah. ‘There is no one here to help me. I am the last to go. Not because I want togo, but because I have to.’ I sat down on the cot and packed a few last things in a suitcase. All the doors ofthe house were locked. On my way to the station I would leave the keys with thecaretaker. I had already given instructions to an agent to try and sell the house.There was nothing more to be done.We walked in silence to the waiting tonga, thinking and wondering about eachother.‘Take me to the station.’ I said to the tonga-driver.The girl stood at the side of the path, on the damp red earth, gazing at me.‘Thank you,’ I said. ‘I hope I shall see you again.’‘I’ll see you in London,’ she said. ‘Or America or Japan. I want to goeverywhere.’‘I’m sure you will,’ I said. ‘And perhaps I’ll come back and we’ll meet again inthis garden. That would be nice, wouldn’t it?’She nodded and smiled. We knew it was an important moment.The tonga-driver spoke to his pony, and the carriage set off down the gravel-path,rattling a little. The girl and I waved to each other.In the girl’s hand was a sprig of coral blossom. As she waved, the blossoms fellapart and danced lightly in the breeze.‘Goodbye!’ I called.‘Goodbye,’ called the girl.The ribbon had come loose from her pigtail and lay on the ground with the coralblossoms.‘I’m going everywhere,’ I said to myself, ‘and no one can stop me.’And she was fresh and clean like the rain and the red earth. 	aakankshaduggal745@gmail.com	2018		RH
2	The Photograph	I was ten years old. My grandmother sat on the string bed, under the mango tree. Itwas late summer and there were sunflowers in the garden and a warm wind in thetrees. My grandmother was knitting a woolen scarf for the winter months. She wasvery old, dressed in a plain white sari; her eyes were not very strong now, but herfingers moved quickly with the needles, and the needles kept clicking all afternoon.Grandmother had white hair, but there were very few wrinkles on her skin.I had come home after playing cricket on the maidan. I had taken my meal, andnow I was rummaging in a box of old books and family heirlooms that had just thatday been brought out of the attic by my mother. Nothing in the box interested mevery much, except for a book with colourful pictures of birds and butterflies. I wasgoing through the book, looking at the pictures, when I found a small photographbetween the pages. It was a faded picture, a little yellow and foggy; it was a pictureof a girl standing against a wall, and behind the wall there was nothing but sky; butfrom the other side a pair of hands reached up, as though someone was going toclimb the wall. There were flowers growing near the girl, but I couldn’t tell whatthey were; there was a creeper too, but it was just a creeper.I ran out into the garden. ‘Granny!’ I shouted. ‘Look at this picture! I found it inthe box of old things. Whose picture is it?’I jumped on the bed beside my grandmother, and she wallopped me on the bottomand said, ‘Now I’ve lost count of my stitches, and the next time you do that I’ll makeyou finish the scarf yourself.’Granny was always threatening to teach me how to knit, which I thought was adisgraceful thing for a boy to do; it was a good deterrent for keeping me out ofmischief. Once I had torn the drawing-room curtains, and Granny had put a needleand thread in my hand and made me stitch the curtain together, even though I madelong, two-inch stitches, which had to be taken out by my mother and done again. She took the photograph from my hand, and we both stared at it for quite a longtime. The girl had long, loose hair, and she wore a long dress that nearly coveredher ankles, and sleeves that reached her wrists, and there were a lot of bangles onher hands; but, despite all this drapery, the girl appeared to be full of freedom andmovement; she stood with her legs apart and her hands on her hips, and she had awide, almost devilish smile on her face.‘Whose picture is it?’ I asked.‘A little girl’s, of course,’ said Grandmother. ‘Can’t you tell?’‘Yes, but did you know the girl?’‘Yes, I knew her,’ said Granny, ‘but she was a very wicked girl and I shouldn’t tellyou about her. But I’ll tell you about the photograph. It was taken in yourgrandfather’s house, about sixty years ago and that’s the garden wall, and over thewall there was a road going to town.’‘Whose hands are they,’ I asked, ‘coming up from the other side?’Grandmother squinted and looked closely at the picture, and shook her head. ‘It’sthe first time I noticed,’ she said. ‘That must have been been the sweeper boy’s. Ormaybe they were your grandfather’s.’‘They don’t look like grandfather’s hands,’ I said. ‘His hands are all bony.’‘Yes, but this was sixty years ago.’‘Didn’t he climb up the wall, after the photo?’‘No, nobody climbed up. At least, I don’t remember.’‘And you remember well, Granny.’‘Yes, I remember ... I remember what is not in the photograph. It was a springday, and there was cool breeze blowing, nothing like this. Those flowers at the girl’sfeet, they were marigolds, and the Bougainvillaea creeper, it was a mass of purple.You cannot see these colours in the photo, and even if you could, as nowadays, youwouldn’t be able to smell the flowers or feel the breeze.’‘And what about the girl?’ I said. ‘Tell me about the girl.’‘Well, she was a wicked girl,’ said Granny. ‘You don’t know the trouble they hadgetting her into those fine clothes she’s wearing.’‘I think they are terrible clothes,’ I said.‘So did she. Most of the time, she hardly wore a thing. She used to go swimmingin a muddy pool with a lot of ruffianly boys, and ride on the backs of buffaloes. Noboy ever teased her, though, because she could kick and scratch and pull his hairout!’ ‘She looks like it too,’ I said. ‘You can tell by the way she’s smiling. At anymoment something’s going to happen.’‘Something did happen,’ said Granny. ‘Her mother wouldn’t let her take off theclothes afterwards, so she went swimming in them, and lay for half-an-hour in themud.’I laughed heartily and Grandmother laughed too.‘Who was the girl?’ I said. ‘You must tell me who she was.’‘No, that wouldn’t do,’ said Grandmother. ‘I won’t tell you.’I knew the girl in the photo was really Grandmother, but I pretended I didn’tknow. I knew, because Grandmother still smiled in the same way, even though shedidn’t have as many teeth.‘Come on, Granny,’ I said, ‘tell me, tell me.’But Grandmother shook her head and carried on with the knitting; and I held thephotograph in my hand looking from it to my grandmother and back again, tryingto find points in common between the old lady and the little pig-tailed girl. A lemon-coloured butterfly settled on the end of Grandmother’s knitting needle, and stayedthere while the needles clicked away. I made a grab at the butterfly, and it flew off ina dipping flight and settled on a sunflower.‘I wonder whose hands they were,’ whispered Grandmother to herself, with herhead bowed, and her needles clicking away in the soft warm silence of that summerafternoon. 	aakankshaduggal745@gmail.com	2017		RH
3	The Window	I came in the spring, and took the room on the roof. It was a long low buildingwhich housed several families; the roof was flat, except for my room and achimney. I don’t know whose room owned the chimney, but my room owned theroof. And from the window of my room I owned the world.But only from the window.The banyan tree, just opposite, was mine, and its inhabitants my subjects. Theywere two squirrels, a few mynahs, a crow, and at night, a pair of flying-foxes. Thesquirrels were busy in the afternoon, the birds in the morning and evening, the foxesat night. I wasn’t very busy that year; not as busy as the inhabitants of the banyantree.There was also a mango tree but that came later, in the summer, when I met Kokiand the mangoes were ripe.At first, I was lonely in my room. But then I discovered the power of my window.It looked out on the banyan tree, on the garden, on the broad path that ran beside thebuilding, and out over the roofs of other houses, over roads and fields, as far as thehorizon. The path was not a very busy one, but it held variety: an ayah, with a babyin a pram; the postman, an event in himself; the fruit-seller, the toy-seller, callingtheir wares in high-pitched familiar cries; the rent-collector; a posse of cyclists; along chain of school-girls; a lame beggar ... all passed my way, the way of mywindow ...In the early summer, a tonga came rattling and jingling down the path and stoppedin front of the house. A girl and an elderly lady climbed down, and a servantunloaded their baggage. They went into the house and the tonga moved off, thehorse snorting a little.The next morning the girl looked up from the garden and saw me at my window.She had long black hair that fell to her waist, tied with a single red ribbon: hereyes were black like her hair and just as shiny. She must have been about ten or eleven years old.‘Hallo,’ I said with a friendly smile.She looked suspiciously at me, ‘Who are you?’ she asked.‘I’m a ghost.’She laughed, and her laugh had a gay, mocking quality: ‘You look like one!’I didn’t think her remark particulary flattering, but I had asked for it. I stoppedsmiling anyway: most children don’t like adults smiling at them all the time.‘What have you got up there?’ she asked.‘Magic,’ I said.She laughed again but this time without mockery. ‘I don’t believe you,’ she said.‘Why don’t you come up and see for yourself?’She hesitated a little but came round to the steps and began climbing them, slowly,cautiously. And when she entered the room, she brought in a magic of her own.‘Where’s your magic?’ she asked, looking me in the eye.‘Come here,’ I said, and I took her to the window, and showed her the world.She said nothing but stared out of the window uncomprehendingly at first, andthen with increasing interest. And after some time she turned round and smiled atme, and we were friends.I only knew that her name was Koki, and that she had come with her aunt for thesummer months; I didn’t need to know any more about her, and she didn’t needknow anything about me except that I wasn’t really a ghost — not the frighteningsort any way ... She came up my steps nearly every day, and joined me at thewindow. There was a lot of excitement to be had in our world, especially when therains broke.At the first rumblings, women would rush outside to retrieve the washing on theclothes-line and, if there was a breeze to chase a few garments across the compound.When the rain came, it came with a vengeance, making a bog of the garden and ariver of the path.A cyclist would come riding furiously down the path, an elderly gentleman wouldbe having difficulty with an umbrella, naked children would be frisking about in therain. Sometimes Koki would run out on the roof, and shout and dance in the rain.And the rain would come through the open door and window of the room, floodingthe floor and making an island of the bed.But the window was more fun than anything else. It gave us the power ofdetachment: we were deeply interested in the life around us, but we were notinvolved in it. ‘It is like a cinema,’ said Koki ‘The window is the screen, the world is thepicture.’Soon the mangoes were ripe, and Koki was in the branches of the mango tree asoften as she was in my room. From the window I had a good view of the tree, andwe spoke to each other from the same height. We ate far too many mangoes, at leastfive a day.‘Let’s make a garden on the roof,’ suggested Koki. She was full of ideas like this.‘And how do you propose to do that?’ I asked.‘It’s easy. We bring up mud and bricks and make the flower-beds. Then we plantthe seeds. We’ll grow all sorts of flowers.’‘The roof will fall in,’ I predicted.But it didn’t. We spent two days carrying buckets of mud up the steps to the roofand laying out the flower-beds. It was very hard work, but Koki did most of it. Whenthe beds were ready, we had the opening ceremony. Apart from a few small plantscollected from the garden below we had only one species of seeds — pumpkin ...We planted the pumpkin-seeds in the mud, and felt proud of ourselves.But it rained heavily that night, and in the morning I discovered that everything —except the bricks — had been washed away.So we returned to the window.A mynah had been in a fight — with the crow perhaps — and the feathers hadbeen knocked off its head. A bougainvillaea that had been climbing the wall had senta long green shoot in through the window.Koki said, ‘Now we can’t shut the window without spoiling the creeper.’‘Then we will never close the window,’ I said.And we let the creeper into the room.The rains passed, and an autumn wind came whispering through the branches ofthe banyan tree. There were red leaves on the ground, and the wind picked them upand blew them about, so that they looked like butterflies. I would watch the sun risein the morning, the sky all red, until its first rays splashed the window-sill and creptup the walls of the room. And in the evening Koki and I watched the sun go down ina sea of fluffy clouds; sometimes the clouds were pink, and sometimes orange; theywere always coloured clouds, framed in the window.‘I’m going tomorrow,’ said Koki one evening.I was too surprised to say anything.‘You stay here forever, don’t you?’ she said.I remained silent.‘When I come again next year you will still be here, won’t you?’‘I don’t know,’ I said, ‘but the window will still be here.’‘Oh, do be here next year,’ she said, ‘or someone will close the window!’In the morning the tonga was at the door, and the servant, the aunt and Koki werein it. Koki waved up to me at my window. Then the driver flicked the reins, thewheels of the carriage creaked and rattled, the bell jingled. Down the path went thetonga, down the path and through the gate, and all the time Koki waved; and fromthe gate I must have looked like a ghost, standing alone at the high window, amongstthe bougainvillaea.When the tonga was out of sight I took the spray of bougainvillaea in my handand pushed it out of the room. Then I closed the window. It would be opened onlywhen the spring and Koki came again. 	aakankshaduggal745@gmail.com	2017		RH
4	Chachi's Funeral	Chachi died at 6 p.m. on Wednesday the 5th of April, and came to life againexactly twenty minutes later. This is how it happened.Chachi was, as a rule, a fairly tolerant, easy-going person, who waddled about thehouse without paying much attention to the swarms of small sons, daughters,nephews and nieces who poured in and out of the rooms. But she had taken aparticular aversion to her ten-year old nephew, Sunil. She was a simple woman andcould not understand Sunil. He was a little brighter than her own sons, moresensitive, and inclined to resent a scolding or a cuff across the head. He was betterlooking then her own children. All this, in addition to the fact that she resentedhaving to cook for the boy while both his parents went out at office jobs, led her togrumble at him a little more than was really necessary.Sunil sensed his aunt’s jealousy and fanned its flames. He was a mischievous boy,and did little things to annoy her, like bursting paper-bags behind her while shedozed, or commenting on the width of her pyjamas when they were hung out to dry.On the evening of the 5th of April, he had been in particulary high spirits, andfeeling hungry, entered the kitchen with the intention of helping himself to somehoney. But the honey was on the top shelf, and Sunil wasn’t quite tall enough tograsp the bottle. He got his fingers to it but as he tilted it towards him, it fell to theground with a crash.Chachi reached the scene of the accident before Sunil could slip away. Removingher slipper, she dealt him three or four furious blows across the head and shoulders.This done, she sat down on the floor and burst into tears.Had the beating come from someone else, Sunil might have cried; but his pridewas hurt, and instead of weeping, he muttered something under his breath andstormed out of the room.Climbing the steps to the roof, he went to his secret hiding-place, a small hole inthe wall of the unused barsati, where he kept his marbles, kite-string, tops, and a clasp-knife. Opening the knife, he plunged it thrice into the soft wood of thewindow-frame.‘I’ll kill her!’ he whispered fiercely, ‘I’ll kill her, I’ll kill her!’‘Who are you going to kill, Sunil?’It was his cousin Madhu, a dark slim girl of twelve, who aided and abetted him inmost of his exploits. Sunil’s Chachi was her ‘Mammi.’ It was a very big family.‘Chachi,’ said Sunil. ‘She hates me, I know. Well, I hate her too. This time I’ll killher.’‘How are you going to do it?’‘I’ll stab with this,’ He showed her the knife.‘Three times, in the heart.’‘But you’ll be caught. The C.I.D. are very clever. Do you want to go to jail?’‘Won’t they hang me?’‘They don’t hang small boys. They send them to boarding-schools.’‘I don’t want to go to a boarding-school.’‘Then better not kill your Chachi. At least not this way. I’ll show you how.’Madhu produced pencil and paper, went down on her hands and knees, andscrewing up her face in sharp concentration, made a rough drawing of Chachi.Then, with a red crayon, she sketched in a big heart in the region of Chachi’sstomach.‘Now,’ she said, ‘stab her to death!’Sunil’s eyes shone with excitement. Here was a great new game. You could alwaysdepend on Madhu for something original. He held the drawing against thewoodwork, and plunged his knife three times into Chachi’s pastel breast.‘You have killed her,’ said Madhu.‘Is that all?’‘Well, if you like, we can cremate her.’‘All right.’She took the torn paper, crumpled it up, produced a box of matches from Sunil’shiding-place, lit a match, and set fire to the paper. In a few minutes all that remainedof Chachi were a few ashes.‘Poor Chachi,’ said Madhu.‘Perhaps we shouldn’t have done it,’ said Sunil beginning to feel sorry.‘I know, we’ll put her ashes in the river!’‘What river?’‘Oh, the drain will do.’ Madhu gathered the ashes together, and leant over the balcony of the roof. Shethrew out her arms, and the ashes drifted downwards. Some of them settled on thepomegranate tree, a few reached the drain and were carried away by a sudden rushof kitchen-water. She turned to face Sunil.Big tears were rolling down Sunil’s cheeks.‘What are you crying for?’ asked Madhu.‘Chachi. I didn’t hate her so much.’‘Then why did you want to kill her?’‘Oh, that was different.’‘Come on, then, let’s go down. I have to do my homework.’As they came down the steps from the roof, Chachi emerged from the kitchen.‘Oh Chachi!’ shouted Sunil. He rushed to her and tried to get his arms around herample waist.‘Now what’s up?’ grumbled Chachi. ‘What is it this time?’‘Nothing, Chachi. I love you so much. Please don’t leave us.’A look of suspicion crossed Chachi’s face. She frowned down the boy. But shewas reassured by the look of genuine affection that she saw in his eyes.‘Perhaps he does care for me, after all,’ she thought: and patting him gently on thehead, she took him by the hand and led him back to the kitchen.

5	The Man Who Was Kipling 	I was sitting on a bench in the Indian Section of the Victoria and Albert Museum inLondon, when a tall, stooping, elderly gentleman sat down beside me. I gave him aquick glance, noting his swarthy features, heavy moustache, and horn-rimmedspectacles. There was something familiar and disturbing about his face, and Icouldn’t resist looking at him again.I noticed that he was smiling at me.‘Do you recognise me?’ he asked, in a soft pleasant voice.‘Well, you do seem familiar,’ I said. ‘Haven’t we met somewhere?’‘Perhaps. But if I seem familiar to you, that is at least something. The troublethese days is that people don’t know me anymore — I’m a familiar, that’s all. Just aname standing for a lot of outmoded ideas.’A little perplexed, I asked, ‘What is it you do?’‘I wrote books once. Poems and tales ... Tell me, whose books do you read?’‘Oh, Maugham, Priestley, Thurber. And among the older lot, Bennett and Wells—.’ I hesitated, groping for an important name, and I noticed a shadow, a sadshadow, pass across my companion’s face.‘Oh, yes, and Kipling,’ I said ‘I read a lot of Kipling.’His face brightened up at once, and the eyes behind the thick-lensed spectaclessuddenly came to life.‘I’m Kipling,’ he said.I stared at him in astonishment, and then, realising that he might perhaps bedangerous, I smiled feebly and said, ‘Oh, yes?’‘You probably don’t believe me. I’m dead, of course.’‘So I thought.’‘And you don’t believe in ghosts?’‘Not as a rule.’‘But you’d have no objection to talking to one, if he came along?’ ‘I’d have no objection. But how do I know you’re Kipling? How do I knowyou’re not an imposter?’‘Listen, then:When my heavens were turned to blood,When the dark had filled my day,Furthest, but most faithful, stoodThat lone star I cast away.I had loved myself, and IHave not lived and dare not die.’‘Once,’ he said, gripping me by the arm and looking me straight in the eye. ‘Oncein life I watched a star; but I whistled, her to go.’‘Your star hasn’t fallen yet,’ I said, suddenly moved, suddenly quite certain that Isat beside Kipling. ‘One day, when there is a new spirit of adventure abroad, we willdiscover you again.’‘Why have they heaped scorn on me for so long?’‘You were too militant, I suppose — too much of an Empire man. You were toopatriotic for your own good.’He looked a little hurt. ‘I was never very political,’ he said. ‘I wrote over sixhundred poems, and you could only call a dozen of them political, I have beenabused for harping on the theme of the White Man’s Burden but my only aim was toshow off the Empire to my audience — and I believed the Empire was a fine andnoble thing. Is it wrong to believe in something? I never went deeply into politicalissues, that’s true. You must remember, my seven years in India were very youthfulyears. I was in my twenties, a little immature if you like, and my interest in India wasa boy’s interest. Action appealed to me more than anything else. You mustunderstand that.’‘No one has described action more vividly, or India so well. I feel at one withKim wherever he goes along the Grand Trunk Road, in the temples at Banaras,amongst the Saharanpur fruit gardens, on the snow-covered Himalayas. Kim hascolour and movement and poetry.’He sighed, and a wistful look came into his eyes.‘I’m prejudiced, of course,’ I continued. ‘I’ve spent most of my life in India —not your India, but an India that does still have much of the colour and atmospherethat you captured. You know, Mr. Kipling, you can still sit in a third-class railwaycarriage and meet the most wonderful assortment of people. In any village you will still find the same courtesy, dignity and courage that the Lama and Kim found ontheir travels.’‘And the Grand Trunk Road? Is it still a long winding procession of humanity?’‘Well, not exactly,’ I said, a little ruefully. ‘It’s just a procession of motor vehiclesnow. The poor Lama would be run down by a truck if he became too dreamy on theGrand Trunk Road. Times have changed. There are no more Mrs. Hawksbees inSimla, for instance.’There was a far-away look in Kipling’s eyes. Perhaps he was imagining himself aboy again; perhaps he could see the hills or the red dust of Rajputana; perhaps hewas having a private conversation with Privates Mulvaney and Ortheris, or perhapshe was out hunting with the Seonce wolf-pack. The sound of London’s traffic cameto us through the glass doors, but we heard only the creaking of bullock-cart wheelsand the distant music of a flute.He was talking to himself, repeating a passage from one of his stories. ‘And thelast puff of the daywind brought from the unseen villages the scent of damp wood-smoke, hot cakes, dripping under-growth, and rotting pine-cones. That is the truesmell of the Himalayas, and if once it creeps into the blood of a man, that man willat the last, forgetting all else, return to the hills to die.’A mist seemed to have risen between us — or had it come in from the streets? —and when it cleared, Kipling had gone away.I asked the gatekeeper if he had seen a tall man with a slight stoop, wearingspectacles.‘Nope,’ said the gatekeeper. ‘Nobody been by for the last ten minutes.’‘Did someone like that come into the gallery a little while ago?’‘No one that I recall. What did you say the bloke’s name was?’‘Kipling,’ I said.‘Don’t know him.’‘Didn’t you ever read The Jungle Books?’‘Sounds familiar. Tarzan stuff, wasn’t it?’I left the museum, and wandered about the streets for a long time, but I couldn’tfind Kipling anywhere. Was it the boom of London’s traffic that I heard, or theboom of the Sutlej river racing through the valleys? 	Aakanksha	2018		RH
6	The Eyes Have It 	I had the train compartment to myself up to Rohana, then a girl got in. The couplewho saw her off were probably her parents; they seemed very anxious about hercomfort, and the woman gave the girl detailed instructions as to where to keep herthings, when not to lean out of windows, and how to avoid speaking to strangers.They called their goodbyes and the train pulled out of the station. As I was totallyblind at the time, my eyes sensitive only to light and darkness, I was unable to tellwhat the girl looked like; but I knew she wore slippers from the way they slappedagainst her heels.It would take me some time to discover something about her looks, and perhaps Inever would. But I liked the sound of her voice, and even the sound of her slippers.‘Are you going all the way to Dehra?’ I asked.I must have been sitting in a dark corner, because my voice startled her. She gavea little exclamation and said, ‘I didn’t know anyone else was here.’Well, it often happens that people with good eyesight fail to see what is right infront of them. They have too much to take in, I suppose. Whereas people who cannotsee (or see very little) have to take in only the essentials, whatever registers mosttellingly on their remaining senses.‘I didn’t see you either,’ I said. ‘But I heard you come in.’I wondered if I would be able to prevent her from discovering that I was blind.Provided I keep to my seat, I thought, it shouldn’t be too difficult.The girl said, ‘I’m getting off at Saharanpur. My aunt is meetingme there.’‘Then I had better not get too familiar,’ I replied. ‘Aunts are usually formidablecreatures.’‘Where are you going?’ she asked.‘To Dehra, and then to Mussoorie.’‘Oh, how lucky you are. I wish I were going to Mussoorie. I love the hills.Especially in October.’‘Yes, this is the best time,’ I said, calling on my memories. ‘The hills are coveredwith wild dahlias, the sun is delicious, and at night you can sit in front of a logfireand drink a little brandy. Most of the tourists have gone, and the roads are quiet andalmost deserted. Yes, October is the best time.’She was silent. I wondered if my words had touched her, or whether she thoughtme a romantic fool. Then I made a mistake.‘What is it like outside?’ I asked.She seemed to find nothing strange in the question. Had she noticed already that Icould not see? But her next question removed my doubts.‘Why don’t you look out of the window?’ she asked.I moved easily along the berth and felt for the window ledge. The window wasopen, and I faced it, making a pretence of studying the landscape. I heard the pantingof the engine, the rumble of the wheels, and, in my mind’s eye, I could see telegraphposts flashing by.‘Have you noticed,’ I ventured, ‘that the trees seem to be moving while we seemto be standing still?’‘That always happens,’ she said. ‘Do you see any animals?’‘No,’ I answered quite confidently. I knew that there were hardly any animals leftin the forests near Dehra.I turned from the window and faced the girl, and for a while we sat in silence.‘You have an interesting face,’ I remarked. I was becoming quite daring, but itwas a safe remark. Few girls can resist flattery. She laughed pleasantly — a clear,ringing laugh.‘It’s nice to be told I have an interesting face. I’m tired of people telling me I havea pretty face.’Oh, so you do have a pretty face, thought I: and aloud I said: ‘Well, an interestingface can also be pretty.’‘You are a very gallant young man,’ she said ‘but why are you so serious?’I thought, then, I would try to laugh for her, but the thought of laughter only mademe feel troubled and lonely.‘We’ll soon be at your station,’ I said.‘Thank goodness it’s a short journey. I can’t bear to sit in a train for more thantwo-or-three hours.’Yet I was prepared to sit there for almost any length of time, just to listen to hertalking. Her voice had the sparkle of a mountain stream. As soon as she left thetrain, she would forget our brief encounter; but it would stay with me for the rest ofthe journey, and for some time after.The engine’s whistle shrieked, the carriage wheels changed their sound andrhythm, the girl got up and began to ollect her things. I wondered if she wore herhair in a bun, or if it was plaited; perhaps it was hanging loose over her shoulders,or was it cut very short?The train drew slowly into the station. Outside, there was the shouting of portersand vendors and a high-pitched female voice near the carriage door; that voice musthave belonged to the girls’ aunt.‘Goodbye,’ the girl said.She was standing very close to me, so close that the perfume from her hair wastantalizing. I wanted to raise my hand and touch her hair, but she moved away. Onlythe scent of perfume still lingered where she had stood.There was some confusion in the doorway. A man, getting into the compartment,stammered an apology. Then the door banged, and the world was shut out again. Ireturned to my berth. The guard blew his whistle and we moved off. Once again, Ihad a game to play and a new fellow-traveller.The train gathered speed, the wheels took up their song, the carriage groaned andshook. I found the window and sat in front of it, staring into the daylight that wasdarkness for me.So many things were happening outside the window: it could be a fascinatinggame, guessing what went on out there.The man who had entered the compartment broke into my reverie.‘You must be disappointed,’ he said. ‘I’m not nearly as attractive a travellingcompanion as the one who just left.’‘She was an interesting girl,’ I said. ‘Can you tell me — did she keep her hairlong or short?’‘I don’t remember,’ he said, sounding puzzled. ‘It was her eyes I noticed, not herhair. She had beautiful eyes — but they were of no use to her. She was completelyblind. Didn’t you notice?’	aakankshaduggal745@gmail.com	2017		RH
7	The Thief	The ThiefI was still a thief when I met Arun, and though I was only fifteen, I was anexperienced and fairly successful hand.Arun was watching the wrestlers when I approached him. He was about twenty, atall, lean fellow, and he looked kind and simple enough for my purpose. I hadn’t hadmuch luck of late, and thought I might be able to get into this young person’sconfidence. He seemed quite fascinated by the wrestling. Two well-oiled men slidabout in the soft mud, grunting and slapping their thighs. When I got Arun intoconversation he didn’t seem to realise I was a stranger.‘You look like a wrestler yourself,’ I said.‘So do you,’ he replied, which put me out of my stride for a moment, because atthe time I was rather thin and bony and not very impressive physically.‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I wrestle sometimes.’‘What’s your name?’‘Deepak,’ I lied.Deepak was about my fifth name. I had earlier called myself Ranbir, Sudhir,Trilok, and Surinder.After this preliminary exchange, Arun confined himslf to comments on thematch, and I didn’t have much to say. After a while he walked away from the crowdof spectators. I followed him.‘Hallo,’ he said. ‘Enjoying yourself?’I gave him my most appealing smile. ‘I want to work for you,’ I said.He didn’t stop walking. ‘And what makes you think I want someone to work forme?’‘Well,’ I said, ‘I’ve been wandering about all day, looking for the best person towork for. When I saw you, I knew that no one else had a chance.’‘You flatter me,’ he said.‘That’s all right.’ ‘But you can’t work for me.’‘Why not?’‘Because I can’t pay you.’I thought that over for a minute. Perhaps I had misjudged my man.‘Can you feed me?’ I asked.‘Can you cook?’ he countered.‘I can cook,’ I lied.‘If you can cook,’ he said, ‘I’ll feed you.’He took me to his room and told me I could sleep in the verandah. But I wasnearly back on the street that night. The meal I cooked must have been pretty awful,because Arun gave it to the neighbour’s cat and told me to be off. But I just hungaround smiling in my most appealing way; and then he couldn’t help laughing. Hesat down on the bed and laughed for a full five minutes, and later patted me on thehead and said, never mind, he’d teach me to cook in the morning.Not only did he teach me to cook, but he taught me to write my name and his, andsaid he would soon teach me to write whole sentences, and add money on paperwhen you didn’t have any in your pocket!It was quite pleasant working for Arun. I made the tea in the morning and laterwent out shopping. I would take my time buying the day’s supplies and made a profitof about 25 paise a day. I would tell Arun that rice was 56 paise a pound (it generallywas), but I would get it at 50 paise a pound. I think he knew I made a little this way,but he didn’t mind, he wasn’t giving me a regular wage.I was really grateful to Arun for teaching me to write. I knew that once I couldwrite like an educated man there would be no limit to what I could achieve. It mighteven be an incentive to be honest.Arun made money by fits and starts. He would be borrowing one week, lendingthe next. He would keep worrying about his next cheque but, as soon as it arrived, hewould go out and celebrate lavishly.One evening he came home with a wad of notes, and at night I saw him tuck thebundles under his mattress, at the head of the bed.I had been working for Arun for nearly a fortnight and, apart from the shopping,hadn’t done much to exploit him. I had every opportunity for doing so. I had a keyto the front door, which meant I had access to the room whenever Arun was out. Hewas the most trusting person I had ever met. And that was why I couldn’t make upmy mind to rob him. It’s easy to rob a greedy man, because he deserves to be robbed; it’s easy to rob arich man, because he can afford to be robbed; but it’s difficult to rob a poor man,even one who really doesn’t care if he’s robbed. A rich man or a greedy man or acareful man wouldn’t keep his money under a pillow or mattress, he’d lock it up ina safe place. Arun had put his money where it would be child’s play for me toremove it without his knowledge.It’s time I did some real work, I told myself; I’m getting out of practice ... If Idon’t take the money, he’ll only waste it on his friends ... He doesn’t even pay me...Arun was asleep. Moonlight came in from the verandah and fell across the bed. Isat up on the floor, my blanket wrapped round me, considering the situation. Therewas quite a lot of money in that wad, and if I took it I would have to leave town — Imight make the 10.30 express to Amritsar ...Slipping out of the blanket, I crept on all fours through the door and up to the bed,and peeped at Arun. He was sleeping peacefully with a soft and easy breathing. Hisface was clear and unlined; even I had more markings on my face, though minewere mostly scars.My hand took on an identity of its own as it slid around under the mattress, thefingers searching for the notes. They found them, and I drew them out without acrackle.Arun sighed in his sleep and turned on his side, towards me. My free hand wasresting on the bed, and his hair touched my fingers.I was frightened when his hair touched my fingers, and crawled quickly andquietly out of the room.When I was in the street, I began to run. I ran down the bazaar road to the station.The shops were all closed, but a few lights came from upper windows. I had the noteat my waist, held there by the string of my pyjamas. I felt I had to stop and count thenotes though I knew it might make me late for the train. It was already 10.20 by theclock tower. I slowed down to a walk, and my fingers flicked through the notes.There were about a hundred rupees in fives. A good haul. I could live like a princefor a month or two.When I reached the station I did not stop at the ticket-office (I had never bought aticket in my life) but dashed straight on to the platform. The Amritsar Express wasjust moving out. It was moving slowly enough for me to be able to jump on thefoot-board of one of the carriages, but I hesitated for some urgent, unexplainablereason. I hesitated long enough for the train to leave without me.When it had gone, and the noise and busy confusion of the platform had subsided,I found myself standing alone on the deserted platform. The knowledge that I had ahundred stolen rupees in my pyjamas only increased my feeling of isolation andloneliness. I had no idea where to spend the night; I had never kept any friends,because sometimes friends can be one’s undoing; I didn’t want to make myselfconspicuous by staying at a hotel. And the only person I knew really well in townwas the person I had robbed!Leaving the station, I walked slowly through the bazaar keeping to dark, desertedalleys. I kept thinking of Arun. He would still be asleep, blissfully unaware of hisloss.I have made a study of men’s faces when they have lost something of materialvalue. The greedy man shows panic, the rich man shows anger, the poor man showsfear; but I knew that neither panic nor anger nor fear would show on Arun’s face,when he discovered the theft; only a terrible sadness not for the loss of the moneybut for my having betrayed his trust.I found myself on the maidan and sat down on a bench with my feet tucked upunder my haunches. The night was a little cold, and I regretted not having broughtArun’s blanket along. A light drizzle added to my discomfort. Soon it was rainingheavily. My shirt and pyjamas stuck to my skin and a cold wind brought the rainwhipping across my face. I told myself that sleeping on a bench was something, Ishould have been used to by now, but the verandah had softened me.I walked back to the bazaar and sat down on the step of a closed shop. A fewvagrants lay beside me, rolled up tight in thin blankets. The clock showed midnight,I felt for the notes; they were still with me, but had lost their crispness and weredamp with rainwater.Arun’s money. In the morning he would probably have given me a rupee to go tothe pictures but now I had it all. No more cooking his meals, running to the bazaar,or learning to write whole sentences. Whole sentences ...They were something I had forgotten in the excitement of a hundred rupees.Whole sentences, I knew, could one day bring me more than a hundred rupees. Itwas a simple matter to steal (and sometimes just as simple to be caught) but to be areally big man, a wise and successful man, that was something. I should go back toArun, I told myself, if only to learn how to write.Perhaps it was also concern for Arun that drew me back; a sense of sympathy isone of my weaknesses, and through hesitation over a theft I had often been caught. A successful thief must be pitiless. I was fond of Arun. My affection for him, my senseof sympathy, but most of all my desire to write whole sentences, drew me back tothe room.I hurried back to the room extremely nervous, for it is easier to steal somethingthan to return it undetected. If I was caught beside the bed now, with the money in myhand, or with my hand under the mattress there could be only one explanation: that Iwas actually stealing. If Arun woke up, I would be lost.I opened the door clumsily, then stood in the doorway in clouded moonlight.Gradually my eyes became accustomed to the darkness of the room. Arun was stillasleep. I went on all fours again and crept noiselessly to the head of the bed. Myhand came up with the notes. I felt his breath on my fingers. I was fascinated by histranquil features and easy breathing and remained motionless for a minute. Then myhand explored the mattress, found the edge, slipped under it with the notes.I awoke late next morning to find that Arun had already made the tea. I found itdifficult to face him in the harsh light of day. His hand was stretched out towards me.There was a five-rupee note between his fingers. My heart sank.‘I made some money yesterday,’ he said. ‘Now you’ll get paid regularly.’ Myspirit rose as rapidly as they had fallen. I congratulated myself on having returnedthe money.But when I took the note, I realised that he knew everything. The note was still wetfrom last night’s rain.‘Today I’ll teach you to write a little more than your name,’ he said.He knew; but neither his lips nor his eyes said anything about their knowing.I smiled at Arun in my most appealing way; and the smile came by itself, withoutmy knowing it. 	aakankshaduggal745@gmail.com	2017		RH
8	The Boy Who Broke the Bank	Nathu grumbled to himself as he swept the steps of the Pipalnagar Bank, owned bySeth Govind Ram. He used the small broom hurriedly and carelessly, and the dust,after rising in a cloud above his head settled down again on the steps. As Nathu wasbanging his pan against a dustbin, Sitaram, the washerman’s son, passed by.Sitaram was on his delivery round. He had a bundle of freshly pressed clothesbalanced on his head.‘Don’t raise such dust!’ he called out to Nathu. ‘Are you annoyed because they arestill refusing to pay you an extra two rupees a month?’‘I don’t wish to talk about it,’ complained the sweeper-boy. ‘I haven’t evenreceived my regular pay. And this is the twentieth of the month. Who would think abank would hold up a poor man’s salary? As soon as I get my money, I’m off! Notanother week I work in this place.’ And Nathu banged the pan against the dustbinseveral times, just to emphasize his point and giving himself confidence.‘Well, I wish you luck,’ said Sitaram. ‘I’ll keep a lookout for any jobs that mightsuit you.’ And he plodded barefoot along the road, the big bundle of clothes hidingmost of his head and shoulders.At the fourth home he visited, Sitaram heard the lady of the house mention thatshe was in need of a sweeper. Tying his bundle together, he said; ‘I know of asweeper boy who’s looking for work. He can start from next month. He’s with thebank just now but they aren’t giving him his pay, and he wants to leave.’‘Is that so?’ said Mrs. Srivastava. ‘Well, tell him to come and see me tomorrow.’And Sitaram, glad that he had been of service to both a customer and his friend,hoisted his bag on his shoulders and went his way.Mrs. Srivastava had to do some shopping. She gave instructions to the ayah aboutlooking after the baby, and told the cook not to be late with the mid-day meal. Thenshe set out for the Pipalnagar market place, to make her customary tour of the clothshops. A large shady tamarind tree grew at one end of the bazaar, and it was here thatMrs. Srivastava found her friend Mrs. Bhushan sheltering from the heat. Mrs.Bhushan was fanning herself with a large handkerchief. She complained of thesummer, which she affirmed, was definitely the hottest in the history of Pipalnagar.She then showed Mrs. Srivastava a sample of the cloth she was going to buy, and forfive minutes they discussed its shade, texture and design. Having exhausted thistopic, Mrs. Srivastava said, ‘Do you know, my dear, that Seth Govind Ram’s bankcan’t even pay its employees? Only this morning I heard a complaint from theirsweeper, who hasn’t received his wages for over a month!’‘Shocking!’ remarked Mrs. Bhushan. ‘If they can’t pay the sweeper they must bein a bad way. None of the others could be getting paid either.’She left Mrs. Srivastava at the tamarind tree and went in search of her husband,who was sitting in front of Kamal Kishore’s photographic shop, talking with theowner.‘So there you are!’ cried Mrs. Bhushan. ‘I’ve been looking for you for almost anhour. Where did you disappear?’‘Nowhere,’ replied Mr. Bhushan. ‘Had you remained stationary in one shop, Imight have found you. But you go from one shop to another, like a bee in a flowergarden.’‘Don’t start grumbling. The heat is trying enough. I don’t know what’s happeningto Pipalnagar. Even the bank’s about to go bankrupt.’‘What’s that?’ said Kamal Kishore, sitting up suddenly. ‘Which bank?’‘Why the Pipalnagar bank of course. I hear they have stopped paying employees.Don’t tell me you have an account there, Mr. Kishore?’‘No, but my neighbour has!’ he exclaimed; and he called out over the lowpartition to the keeper of the barber shop next door. ‘Deep Chand, have you heardthe latest? The Pipalnagar Bank is about to collapse. You’d better get your moneyout as soon as you can!’Deep Chand who was cutting the hair of an elderly gentleman, was so startled thathis hand shook and he nicked his customer’s right ear. The customer yelped withpain and distress: pain, because of the cut and distress because of the awful news hehad just heard. With one side of his neck still unshaven, he sped across the road tothe general merchant’s store where there was a telephone. He dialled Seth GovindRam’s number. The Seth was not at home. Where was he, then? The Seth washolidaying in Kashmir. Oh, was that so? The elderly gentleman did not believe it. Hehurried back to the barber’s shop and told Deep Chand: ‘The bird has flown! Seth Govind Ram has left town. Definitely, it means a collapse.’ And then he dashed outof the shop, making a beeline for his office and chequebook.The news spread through the bazaar with the rapidity of forest fire. From thegeneral merchant’s it travelled to the shop, circulated amongst the customers, andthen spread with them in various directions, to the betel-seller, the tailor, the freevendor, the jeweller, the beggar sitting on the pavement.Old Ganpat the beggar, had a crooked leg. He had been squatting on the pavementfor years, calling for alms. In the evening someone would come with a barrow andtake him away. He had never been known to walk. But now, on learning that the bankwas about to collapse, Ganpat astonished everyone leaping to his feet and actuallyrunning at top speed in the direction of the bank. It soon became known that he had athousand rupees in savings!Men stood in groups at street corners discussing the situation. Pipalnagar seldomhad a crisis, seldom or never had floods, earthquakes or drought; and the imminentcrash of the Pipalnagar Bank set everyone talking and speculating and rushing aboutin a frenzy. Some boasted of their farsightedness, congratulating themselves onhaving already taken out their money, or on never having put any in; othersspeculated on the reasons for the crash, putting it all down to excesses indulged inby Seth Govind Ram. The Seth had fled the State, said one. He had fled the country,said another, He was hiding in Pipalnagar, said a third. He had hanged himself fromthe tamarind tree, said a fourth, and had been found that morning by the sweeper-boy.By noon the small bank had gone through all; its ready cash, and the harassedmanager was in a dilemma. Emergency funds could only be obtained from anotherbank some thirty miles distant, and he wasn’t sure he could persuade the crowd towait until then. And there was no way of contacting Seth Govind Ram on hishouseboat in Kashmir.People were turned back from the counters and told to return the following day.They did not like the sound of that. And so they gathered outside, on the steps of thebank shouting ‘Give us our money or we’ll break in!’ and ‘Fetch the Seth, we knowhe’s hiding in a safe deposit locker!’ Mischief makers who didn’t have a paisa in thebank, joined the crowd and aggravated their mood. The man ager stood at the doorand tried to placate them. He declared that the bank had plenty of money but noimmediate means of collecting it; he urged them to go home and come back the nextday.‘We want it now!’ chanted some of the crowd. ‘Now, now, now!’ And a brick hurtled through the air and crashed through the plate glass window ofthe Pipalnagar Bank.Nathu arrived next morning to sweep the steps of the bank. He saw the refuse andthe broken glass and the stones cluttering the steps. Raising his hands in a gesture ofhorror and disgust he cried: ‘Hooligans! Sons of donkeys! As though it isn’t badenough to be paid late, it seems my work has also to be increased!’ He smote thesteps with his broom scattering the refuse.Good morning, Nathu,’ said the washerman’s boy, getting down from his bicycle.‘Are you ready to take up a new job from the first of next month? You’ll have to Isuppose, now that the bank is going out of business.’‘How’s that?’ said Nathu.‘Haven’t you heard? Well you’d better wait here until half the population ofPipalnagar arrives to claim their money.’ And he waved cheerfully — he did nothave a bank account — and sped away on his cycle.Nathu went back to sweeping the steps, muttering to himself. When he hadfinished his work, he sat down on the highest step, to await the arrival of themanager. He was determined to get his pay.‘Who would have thought the bank would collapse!’ he said to himself, andlooked thoughtfully into the distance. ‘I wonder how it could have happened ...

9	His Neighbour’s Wife	 No (said Arun, as we waited for dinner to be prepared), I did not fall in love withmy neighbour’s wife. It is not that kind of story.Mind you, Leela was a most attractive woman. She was not beautiful or pretty; butshe was handsome. Hers was the firm, athletic body of a sixteen-year-old boy, freeof any surplus flesh. She bathed morning and evening, oiling herself well, so thather skin glowed a golden-brown in the winter sunshine. Her lips were oftencoloured with paan-juice, but her teeth were perfect.I was her junior by about five years, and she called me her ‘younger brother’.Her husband, who was forty to her thirty-two, was an official in the Customs andExcise Department: an extrovert, a hard-drinking, backslapping man, who spent agreat deal of time on tour. Leela knew that he was not always faithful to her duringthese frequent absences; but she found solace in her own loyalty and in the well-being of her one child, a boy called Chandu.I did not care for the boy. He had been well-spoilt, and took great delight indisturbing me whenever I was at work. He entered my rooms uninvited, knocked mybooks about, and, if guests were present, made insulting remarks about them to theirfaces.Leela, during her lonely evenings, would often ask me to sit on her verandah andtalk to her. The day’s work done, she would relax with a hookah. Smoking a hookahwas a habit she had brought with her from her village near Agra, and it was a habitshe refused to give up. She liked to talk; and, as I was a good listener, she soon grewfond of me. The fact that I was twenty-six years old, and still a bachelor, never failedto astonish her.It was not long before she took upon herself the responsibility for getting memarried. I found it useless to protest. She did not believe me when I told her that Icould not afford to marry, that I preferred a bachelor’s life. A wife, she insisted, wasan asset to any man. A wife reduced expenses. Where did I eat? At a hotel, of course. That must cost me at least sixty rupees a month, even on a vegetarian diet. But if Ihad a simple, homely wife to do the cooking, we could both eat well for less thanthat.Leela fingered my shirt, observing that a button was missing and that the collarwas frayed. She remarked on my pale face and general look of debility; and told methat I would fall victim to all kinds of diseases if I did not find someone to look afterme. What I needed, she declared betweeen puffs at the hookah, was a woman — ayoung, healthy, buxom woman, preferably from a village near Agra.‘If I could find someone like you,’ I said slyly, ‘I would not mind gettingmarried.’She appeared neither flattered nor offended by my remark.‘Don’t marry an older woman,’ she advised. ‘Never take a wife who is moreexperienced in the ways of the world than you are. You just leave it to me, I’ll find asuitable bride for you.’To please Leela, I agreed to this arrangement, thinking she would not take itseriously. But, two days later, when she suggested that I accompany her to a certaindistinguished home for orphan girls, I became alarmed. I refused to have anythingto do with her project.‘Don’t you have confidence in me?’ she asked. ‘You said you would like a girlwho resembled me. I know one who looks just as I did ten years ago.’‘I like you as you are now,’ I said. ‘Not as you were ten years ago.’‘Of course. We shall arrange for you to see the girl first.’‘You don’t understand,’ I protested. ‘It’s not that I feel I have to be in love withsomeone before marrying her — I know you would choose a fine girl, and I wouldreally prefer someone who is homely and simple to an M.A. with Honours inPsychology — it’s just that I’m not ready for it. I want another year or two offreedom. I don’t want to be chained down. To be frank, I don’t want theresponsibility.’‘A little responsibility will make a man of you,’ said Leela; but she did not insiston my accompanying her to the orphanage, and the matter was allowed to rest for afew days.I was beginning to hope that Leela had reconciled herself to allowing one man toremain single in a world full of husbands when, one morning, she accosted me onthe verandah with an open newspaper, which she thrust in front of my nose.‘There!’ she said triumphantly. ‘What do you think of that? I did it to surpriseyou.’ She had certainly succeeded in surprising me. Her henna-stained forefinger restedon an advertisement in the matrimonial columns.Bachelor journalist, age 25, seeks attractive young wife well-versed in householdduties. Caste, religion no bar. Dowry optional.I must admit that Leela had made a good job, of it. In a few days the replies beganto come in, usually from the parents of the girls concerned. Each applicant wantedto know how much money I was earning. At the same time, they took the trouble tolist their own connections and the high positions occupied by relatives. Someparents enclosed their daughters’ photographs. They were very good photographs,though there had been a certain amount of touching-up.I studied the pictures with interest. Perhaps marriage wasn’t such a badproposition, after all. I selected the photographs of the three girls I most fancied andshowed them to Leela.To my surprise, she disapproved of all three. One of the girls she said, had a facelike a hermaphrodite; another obviously suffered from tuberculosis; and the thirdwas undoubtedly an adventuress. Leela decided that the whole idea of theadvertisement had been a mistake. She was sorry she had inserted it; the only replieswe were likely to get would be from fortune-hunters. And I had no fortune.So we destroyed the letters. I tried to keep some of the photographs, but Leelatore them up too.And so, for some time, there were no more attempts at getting me married.Leela and I met nearly every day, but we spoke of other things. Sometimes, in theevenings, she would make me sit on the charpoy opposite her, and then she woulddraw up her hookah and tell me stories about her village and her family. I wasgetting used to the boy, too, and even growing rather fond of him.All this came to an end when Leela’s husband went and got himself killed. He wasshot by a bootlegger who had decided to get rid of the Excise man rather than payhim an exorbitant sum of money. It meant that Leela had to give up her quarters andreturn to her village near Agra. She waited until the boy’s school-term had finished,and then she packed their things and bought two tickets, third-class to Agra.Something, I could see, had been troubling her, and when I saw her off at thestation I realised what it was. She was having fit of conscience about my continuedbachelorhood.‘In my village,’ she said confidently, leaning out from the carriage window,‘there is a very comely young girl, a distant relative of mine, I shall speak to theparents.’ And then I said something which I had not considered before: which had never,until that moment, entered my head. And I was no less surprised than Leela when thewords came tumbling out of my mouth: ‘Why don’t you marry me now?’Arun didn’t have time to finish his story because, just as this interesting stage, thedinner arrived.But the dinner brought with it the end of his story.It was served by his wife, a magnificent woman, strong and handsome, who couldonly have been Leela. And a few minutes later, Chandu, Arun’s stepson, charged intothe house, complaining that he was famished.Arun introduced me to his wife, and we exchanged the usual formalities.‘But why hasn’t your friend brought his family with him?’ she asked.‘Family? Because he’s still a bachelor!’And then as he watched his wife’s expression change from a look of mildindifference to one of deep concern, he hurriedly changed the subject. 	Aakanksha	2017		RH
10	The Night Train at Deoli	When I was at college I used to spend my summer vacations in Dehra, at mygrandmother’s place. I would leave the plains early in May and return late in July.Deoli was a small station about thirty miles from Dehra; it marked the beginning ofthe heavy jungles of the Indian Terai.The train would reach Deoli at about five in the morning, when the station wouldbe dimly lit with electric bulbs and oil-lamps, and the jungle across the railwaytracks would just be visible in the faint light of dawn. Deoli had only lone platform,an office for the stationmaster and a waiting room. The platform boasted a tea stall,a fruit vendor, and a few stray dogs; not much else, because the train stopped therefor only ten minutes before rushing on into the forests.Why it stopped at Deoli. I don’t know. Nothing ever happened there. Nobody gotoff the train and nobody got in. There were never any coolies on the platform. Butthe train would halt there a full ten minutes, and then a bell would sound, the guardwould blow his whistle, and presently Deoli would be left behind and forgotten.I used to wonder what happened in Deoli, behind the station walls. I always feltsorry for that lonely little platform, and for the place that nobody wanted to visit. Idecided that one day I would get off the train at Deoli, and spend the day there, justto please the town.I was eighteen, visiting my grandmother, and the night train stopped at Deoli. Agirl came down the platform, selling baskets.It was a cold morning and the girl had a shawl thrown across her shoulders. Herfeet were bare and her clothes were old, but she was a young girl, walkinggracefully and with dignity.When she came to my window, she stopped. She saw that I was looking at herintently, but at first she pretended not to notice. She had a pale skin, set off by shinyblack hair, and dark, troubled eyes. And then those eyes, searching and eloquent, metmine. She stood by my window for some time and neither of us said anything. But whenshe moved on, I found myself leaving my seat and going to the carriage door, andstood waiting on the platform, looking the other way. I walked across to the tea stall.A kettle was boiling over on a small fire, but the owner of the stall was busy servingtea somewhere on the train. The girl followed me behind the stall.‘Do you want to buy a basket?’ she asked. ‘They are very strong, made of thefinest cane ...’‘No,’ I said, ‘I don’t want a basket.’We stood looking at each other for what seemed a very long time, and she said,‘Are you sure you don’t want a basket?’‘All right, give me one,’ I said, and I took the one on top and gave her a rupee,hardly daring to touch her fingers.As she was about to speak, the guard blew his whistle; she said something, but itwas lost in the clanging of the bell and the hissing of the engine. I had to run back tomy compartment. The carriage shuddered and jolted forward.I watched her as the platform slipped away. She was alone on the platform and shedid not move, but she was looking at me and smiling. I watched her until the signal-box came in the way, and then the jungle hid the station, but I could still see herstanding there alone ...I sat up awake for the rest of the journey. I could not rid my mind of the picture ofthe girl’s face and her dark, smouldering eyes.But when I reached Dehra the incident became blurred and distant, for there wereother things to occupy my mind. It was only when I was making the return journey,two months later, that I remembered the girl.I was looking out for her as the train drew into the station, and I felt anunexpected thrill when I saw her walking up the platform. I sprang off the foot-board and waved to her.When she saw me, she smiled. She was pleased that I remembered her. I waspleased that, she remembered me. We were both pleased, and it was almost like ameeting of old friends.She did not go down the length of the train selling baskets, but came straight tothe tea stall; her dark eyes were suddenly filled with light. We said nothing for sometime but we couldn’t have been more eloquent.I felt the impulse to put her on the train there and then, and take her away with me;I could not bear the thought of having to watch her recede into the distance of Deoli station. I took the baskets from her hand and put them down on the ground. She putout her hand for one of them, but I caught her hand and held it.‘I have to go to Delhi,’ I said.She nodded. ‘I do not have to go anywhere.’The guard blew his whistle for the train to leave and how I hated the guard fordoing that.‘I will come again,’ I said. ‘Will you be here?’She nodded again, and, as she nodded, the bell clanged and the train slid forward.I had to wrench my hand away from the girl and run for the moving train.This time I did not forget her. She was with me for the remainder of the journey,and for long after. All that year she was a bright, living thing. And when the collegeterm finished I packed in haste and left for Dehra earlier than usual. Mygrandmother would be pleased at my eagerness to see her.I was nervous and anxious as the train drew into Deoli, because I was wonderingwhat I should say to the girl and what I should do. I was determined that I wouldn’tstand helplessly before her, hardly able to speak or do anything about my feelings.The train came to Deoli, and I looked up and down the platform, but I could notsee the girl anywhere.I opened the door and stepped off the footboard. I was deeply disappointed, andovercome by a sense of foreboding. I felt I had to do something, and so I ran up tothe station-master and said, ‘Do you know the girl who used to sell baskets here?’‘No, I don’t,’ said the station-master. ‘And you’d better get on the train if youdon’t want to be left behind.’But I paced up and down the platform, and stared over the railings at the stationyard; all I saw was a mango tree and a dusty road leading into the jungle. Where didthe road go? The train was moving out of the station, and I had to run up theplatform and jump for the door of my compartment. Then, as the train gatheredspeed and rushed through the forests, I sat brooding in front of the window.What could I do about finding a girl I had seen only twice, who had hardly spokento me, and about whom I knew nothing — absolutely nothing — but for whom I felta tenderness and responsibility that I had never felt before?My grandmother was not pleased with my visit after all, because I didn’t stay ather place more than a couple of weeks. I felt restless and ill-at-ease. So I took thetrain back to the plains, meaning to ask further questions of the station-master atDeoli. But at Deoli there was a new station-master. The previous man had beentransferred to another post within the past week. The new man didn’t know anythingabout the girl who sold baskets. I found the owner of the tea stall, a small,shrivelled-up man, wearing greasy clothes, and asked him if he knew anything aboutthe girl with the baskets.‘Yes, there was such a girl here, I remember quite well,’ he said. ‘But she hasstopped coming now.’‘Why?’ I asked. ‘What happened to her?’‘How should I know?’ said the man. ‘She was nothing to me.’And once again I had to run for the train.As Deoli platform receded, I decided that one day I would have to break journeythere, spend a day in the town, make enquiries, and find the girl who had stolen myheart with nothing but a look from her dark, impatient eyes.With this thought I consoled myself throughout my last term in college. I went toDehra again in the summer and when, in the early hours of the morning, the nighttrain drew into Deoli station, I looked up and down the platform for signs of thegirl, knowing, I wouldn’t find her but hoping just the same.Somehow, I couldn’t bring myself to break journey at Deoli and spend a daythere. (If it was all fiction or a film, I reflected, I would have got down and cleanedup the mystery and reached a suitable ending for the whole thing). I think I wasafraid to do this. I was afraid of discovering what really happened to the girl.Perhaps she was no longer in Deoli, perhaps she was married, perhaps she hadfallen ill ...In the last few years I have passed through Deoli many times, and I always lookout of the carriage window, half expecting to see the same unchanged face smilingup at me. I wonder what happens in Deoli, behind the station walls. But I will neverbreak my journey there. It may spoil my game. I prefer to keep hoping anddreaming, and looking out of the window up and down that lonely platform, waitingfor the girl with the baskets.I never break my journey at Deoli, but I pass through as often as I can.

11	Bus Stop, Pipalnagar	become webbed. Get it into your hair, and there is nothing you can do except go toDeep Chand and have your head shaved.London has its fog, Paris its sewers, Pipalnagar its mud. Pitamber, of coursesucceeded in getting as his passenger the most attractive girl to step off the bus, andshowed her his skill and daring by taking her to her destination by the longest androughest road.The rain swirled over the trees and roofs of the town, and the parched earthsoaked it up, giving out a fresh smell that came only once a year, the fragrance ofquenched earth, that loveliest of all smells.In my room I was battling against the elements, for the door would not close, andthe rain swept into the room and soaked my cot. When finally I succeeded in closingthe door, I discovered that the roof was leaking, and the water was trickling downthe walls, running through the dusty designs I had made with my feet. I placed tinsand mugs in strategic positions and, satisfied that everything was now under control,sat on the cot to watch the roof-tops through the windows.There was a loud banging on the door. It flew open, and there was Suraj, standingon the threshold, drenched. Coming in, he began to dry himself while I madedesperate efforts to close the door again.‘Let’s make some tea,’ he said.Glasses of hot sweet milky tea on a rainy day ... It was enough to make me feelfresh and full of optimism. We sat on the cot, enjoying the brew.‘One day I’ll write a book,’ I said. ‘Not just a thriller, but a real book, about realpeople. Perhaps about you and me and Pipalnagar. And then we’ll be famous andour troubles will be over and new troubles will begin. I don’t mind problems aslong as they are new. While you’re studying, I’ll write my book. I’ll start tonight. Itis an auspicious time, the first night of the monsoon.’A tree must have fallen across the wires somewhere, because the lights would notcome on. So I lit a small oil-lamp, and while it spluttered in the steamy darkness,Suraj opened his books and, with one hand on the book, the other playing with histoes — this helped him to concentrate!— he began to study. I took the ink downfrom the shelf, and, finding it empty, added a little rain-water to it from one of themugs. I sat down beside Suraj and began to write; but the pen was no good and madeblotches all over the paper. And, although I was full of writing just then, I didn’treally know what I wanted to say.So I went out and began pacing up and down the road. There I found Pitamber, alittle drunk very merry, and prancing about in the middle of the road. ‘What are you dancing for?’ I asked.‘I’m happy, so I’m dancing,’ said Pitamber.‘And why are you happy?’ I asked.‘Because I’m dancing,’ he said.The rain stopped and the neem trees gave out a strong sweet smell.XIIFlowers in Pipalnagar — did they exist? As a child I knew a garden in Lucknowwhere there were beds of phlox and petunias; and another garden where only rosesgrew. In the fields around Pipal nagar thorn-apple — a yellow buttercup nestlingamong thorn leaves. But in the Pipalnagar bazaar, there were no flowers except one— a marigold growing out of a crack on my balcony. I had removed the plasterfrom the base of the plant, and filled in a little earth which I watered every morning.The plant was healthy, and sometimes it produced a little orange marigold.Sometimes Suraj plucked a flower and kept it in his tray, among the combs,buttons, and scent-bottles. Sometimes he gave the flower to a passing child, once toa small boy who immediately tore it to shreds. Suraj was back on his rounds, as hisexams were over.Whenever he was tired of going from house to house, Suraj would sit beneath ashady banyan or peepul tree, put his tray aside, and take out his flute. The hauntingnotes travelled down the road in the afternoon stillness, drawing children to him.They would sit besides him and be very quiet when he played, because there wassomething melancholic and appealing about the tunes. Suraj sometimes made flutesout of pieces of bamboo; but he never sold them. He would give them to thechildren he liked. He would sell almost anything, but not flutes.Suraj sometimes played the flute at night, when he lay awake, unable to sleep; buteven though I slept, I could hear the music in my dreams. Sometimes he took hisflute with him to the crooked tree, and played for the benefit of the birds. Theparrots made harsh noise in response and flew away. Once, when Suraj was playinghis flute to a small group of children, he had a fit. The flute fell from his hands. Andhe began to roll about in the dust on the roadside. The children became frightenedand ran away, but they did not stay away for long. The next time they heard the flute,they came to listen as usual.XIII It was Lord Krishna’s birthday, and the rain came down as heavily as it is said tohave done on the day Krishna was born. Krishna is the best beloved of all the Gods.Young mothers laugh or weep as they read or hear the pranks of his boyhood;young men pray to be as tall and as strong as Krishna was when he killed KingKamsa’s elephant and Kamsa’s wrestlers; young girls dream of a lover as daring asKrishna to carry them off in a war-chariot; grown-up men envy the wisdom andstatesmanship with which he managed the affairs of his kingdom.The rain came so unexpectedly that it took everyone by surprise. In seconds,people were drenched, and within minutes, the street was flooded. The temple tankoverflowed, the railway-lines disappeared, and the old wall near the bus stopshivered and silently fell, the sound of its collapse drowned in the downpour. Anaked young man with a dancing bear cavorted in the middle of the vegetablemarket. Pitamber’s rickshaw churned through the flood-water while he sang lustilyas he workedWading knee-deep down the road, I saw the roadside vendors salvaging whateverthey could. Plastic toys, cabbages and utensils floated away and were seized byurchins. The water had risen to the level of the shop-fronts and floors were awash.Deep Chand and Ramu, with the help of a customer, were using buckets to bail thewater out of their shop. The rain stopped as suddenly as it had begun and the suncame out. The water began to find an outlet, flooding other low-lying areas, and apaper-boat came sailing between my legs.Next morning, the morning on which the result of Suraj’s examinations were due,I rose early — the first time I ever got up before Suraj — and went down to thenews agency. A small crowd of students had gathered at the bus stop, joking witheach other and hiding their nervousness with a show of indifference. There were notmany passengers on the first bus, and there was a mad grab for newspapers as thebundle landed with a thud on the pavement. Within half-an-hour, the newsboy hadsold all his copies. It was the best day of the year for him.I went through the columns relating to Pipalnagar, but I couldn’t find Suraj’s rollnumber on the list of successful candidates. I had the number on a slip of paper, andI looked at it again to make sure I had compared it correctly with the others; then Iwent through the newspaper once more. When I returned to the room, Suraj wassitting on the doorstep. I didn’t have to tell him he had failed — he knew by the lookon my face. I sat down beside him, and we said nothing for sometime.‘Never mind,’ Suraj said eventually. ‘I will pass next year.’I realized I was more depressed than he was and that he was trying to console me. ‘If only you’d had more time,’ I said.‘I have plenty of time now. Another year. And you will have time to finish yourbook, and then we can go away together. Another year of Pipalnagar won’t be sobad. As long as I have your friendship, almost everything can be tolerated.’ He stoodup, the tray hanging from his shoulders. What would you like to buy?’XIVAnother year of Pipalnagar! But it was not to be. A short time later, I received aletter from the editor of a newspaper, calling me to Delhi for an interview. Myfriends insisted that I should go. Such an opportunity would not come again.But I needed a shirt. The few I possessed were either frayed at the collars or tornat the shoulders. I hadn’t been able to afford a new shirt for over a year, and Icouldn’t afford one now. Struggling writers weren’t expected to dress very well, butI felt in order to get the job, I would need both a haircut and a clean shirt.Where was I to go to get a shirt? Suraj generally wore an old red-striped T-shirt;he washed it every second evening, and by morning it was dry and ready to wearagain; but it was tight even on him. He did not have another. Besides, I neededsomething white, something respectable!I went to Deep Chand who had a collection of shirts. He was only too glad to lendme one. But they were all brightly coloured — pinks, purples and magentas ... Noeditor was going to be impressed by a young writer in a pink shirt. They looked fineon Deep Chand, but he had no need to look respectable.Finally Pitamber came to my rescue. He didn’t bother with shirts himself, exceptin winter, but he was able to borrow a clean white shirt from a guard at the jail,who’d got it from the relative of a convict in exchange for certain favours.‘This shirt will make you look respectable,’ said Pitamber. ‘To be respectable —what an adventure!’XVFreedom. The moment the bus was out of Pipalnagar, and the fields opened out onall sides, I knew that I was free, that I always had been free. Only my own weakness,hesitation, and the habits that had grown around me had held me back. All I had todo was to sit in a bus and go somewhere.I sat near the open window of the bus and let the cool breeze from the fields playagainst my face. Herons and snipe waded among the lotus roots in flat green ponds. Bluejays swooped around telegraph poles. Children jumped naked into the canalsthat wound through the fields. Because I was happy, it seemed to me that everyoneelse was happy — the driver, the conductor, the passengers, the farmers in the fieldsand those driving bullock-carts. When two women behind me started quarrellingover their seats. I helped to placate them. Then I took a small girl on my knee andpointed out camels, buffaloes, vultures, and parriah-dog.Six hours later the bus crossed the bridge over the swollen Jamuna river, passedunder the walls of the great Red Fort built by a Moghul Emperor, and entered theold city of Delhi. I found it strange to be in a city again, after several years inPipalnagar. It was a little frightening, too. I felt like a stranger. No one wasinterested in me.In Pipalnagar, people wanted to know each other, or at least to know about oneanother. In Delhi, no one cared who you were or where you came from like bigcities almost everywhere, it was prosperous but without a heart.After a day and a night of loneliness, I found myself wishing that Suraj hadaccompanied me; wishing that I was back in Pipalnagar. But when the job wasoffered to me — at a starting salary of three hundred rupees per month, a princelysum, compared to what I had been making on my own — I did not have the courageto refuse it. After accepting the job — which was to commence in a week’s time — Ispent the day wandering through the bazaars, down the wide shady roads of thecapital, resting under the jamun trees, and thinking all the time of what I would do inthe months to come.I slept at the railway waiting-room and all night long I heard the shunting andwhistling of engines which conjured up visions of places with sweet names likeKumbakonam, Krishnagiri, Polonnarurawa. I dreamt of palm-fringed beaches andinland lagoons, of the echoing chambers of deserted cities, red sandstone and whitemarble; of temples in the sun, and elephants crossing wide slow-moving rivers ...XVIPitamber was on the platform when the train steamed into the Pipalnagar station inthe early hours of a damp September morning. I waved to him from the carriagewindow, and shouted that everything had gone well.But everything was not well here. When I got off the train, Pitamber told me thatSuraj had been ill — that he’d a fit on a lonely stretch of road the previousafternoon and had lain in the sun for over-an-hour. Pitamber had found him,suffering from heat-stroke, and brought him home. When I saw him, he was sitting up on the string-bed drinking hot tea. He looked pale and weak, but his smile wasreassuring.‘Don’t worry,’ he said. ‘I will be all right.’‘He was bad last night,’ said Pitamber. ‘He had a fever and kept talking, as in adream. But what he says is true — he is better this morning.’‘Thanks to Pitamber,’ said Suraj. ‘It is good to have friends.’‘Come with me to Delhi, Suraj,’ I said. ‘I have got a job now. You can live withme and attend a school regularly.’‘It is good for friends to help each other,’ said Suraj, ‘but only after I have passedmy exam will I join you in Delhi. I made myself this promise. Poor Pipalnagar —nobody wants to stay here. Will you be sorry to leave?’‘Yes, I will be sorry. A part of me will still be here.’XVIIDeep Chand was happy to know that I was leaving. ‘I’ll follow you soon,’ he said.‘There is money to be made in Delhi, cutting hair. Girls are keeping it short thesedays.’‘But men are growing it long.’‘True. So I shall open a Barber Shop for Ladies and a Beauty Salon for Men!Ramu can attend to the ladies.’Ramu winked at me in the mirror. He was still at the stage of teasing girls on theirway to school or college.The snip of Deep Chand’s scissors made me sleepy, as I sat in his chair. Hisfingers beat a rhythmic tatto on my scalp. It was my last hair-cut in Pipalnagar, andDeep Chand did not charge me for it. I promised to write as soon as I had settleddown in Delhi.The next day when Suraj was stronger, I said, ‘Come, let us go for a walk andvisit our crooked tree. Where is your flute, Suraj?’‘I don’t know. Let us look for it.’We searched the room and our belongings for the flute but could not find it.‘It must have been left on the roadside,’ said Suraj. ‘Never mind, I will makeanother.’I could picture the flute lying in the dust on the roadside and somehow this mademe feel sad. But Suraj was full of high spirits as we walked across the railway-linesand through the fields. ‘The rains are over,’ he said, kicking off his chappals and lying down on thegrass. ‘You can smell the autumn in the air. Somehow, it makes me feel light-hearted. Yesterday I was sad, and tomorrow I might be sad again, but today I knowthat I am happy. I want to live on and on. One lifetime cannot satisfy my heart.’‘A day in a lifetime,’ I said ‘I’ll remember this day — the way the sun touches us,the way the grass bends, the smell of this leaf as I crush it ...’XVIIIAt six every morning the first bus arrives, and the passengers alight, looking sleepyand dishevelled, and rather discouraged by their first sight of Pipalnagar. When theyhave gone their various ways, the bus is driven into the shed. Cows congregate at thedustbin, and the pavement dwellers come to life, stretching their tired limbs on thehard stone steps. I carry the bucket up the steps to my room, and bathe for the lasttime on the open balcony. In the villages, the buffaloes are wallowing in greenponds, while naked urchins sit astride them, scrubbing their backs, and a crow orwater-bird perches on their glistening necks. The parrots are busy in the crookedtree, and a slim green snake basks in the sun on our island near the brick-kiln. In thehills, the mists have lifted and the distant mountains are fringed with snow.It is autumn, and the rains are over. The earth meets the sky in one broad, boldsweep.A land of thrusting hills. Terraced hills, wood-covered and wind-swept.Mountains where the Gods speak gently to the lonely. Hills of green grass and greyrock, misty at dawn, hazy at noon, molten at sunset, where fierce fresh torrents rushto the valleys below. A quiet land of fields and ponds, shaded by ancient trees andringed with palms, where sacred rivers are touched by temples, where temples aretouched by southern seas.This is the land I should write about. Pipalnagar should be forgotten: I should turnaside from it to sing instead of the splendours of exotic places.But only yesterdays are truly splendid ... And there are other singers, sweeterthan I, to sing of tomorrow. I can only write of today, of Pipalnagar, where I havelived and loved. The Garlands on His BrowFame has but a fleeting holdon the reins in our fast-paced society;so many of yesterday’sheroes crumble.Shortly after my return from England, I was walking down the main road of my oldhome town of Dehra, gazing at the shops and passers-by to see what changes, if any,had taken place during my absence. I had been away three years. Still a boy when Iwent abroad, I was twenty-one when I returned with some mediocre qualifications toflaunt in the faces of my envious friends. (I did not tell them of the loneliness ofthose years in exile; it would not have impressed them). I was nearing the clocktower when I met a beggar coming from the opposite directon. In one respect,Dehra had not changed. The beggars were as numerous as ever, though I must admitthey looked healthier.This beggar had a straggling beard, a hunch, a cavernous chest, and unsteady legson which a number of purple sores were festering. His shoulders looked as thoughthey had once been powerful, and his hands thrusting a begging-bowl at me, werestill strong.He did not seem sufficiently decrepit to deserve of my charity, and I was turningaway when I thought I discerned a gleam of recognition in his eyes. There wassomething slightly familiar about the man; perhaps he was a beggar whoremembered me from earlier years. He was even attempting a smile; showing me afew broken yellow fangs; and to get away from him, I produced a coin, dropped itin his bowl, and hurried away.I had gone about a hundred yards when, with a rush of memory, I knew theidentity of the beggar.

12	A Guardian Angel	I can still picture the little Dilaram bazaar as I first saw it 20 years ago. Hanging onthe hem of Aunt Mariam’s sari, I had followed her along the sunlit length of thedusty road and up the wooden staircase to her rooms above the barber’s shop.There were number of children playing in the road, and they all stared at me.They must have wondered what my dark, black haired aunt was doing with a strangechild who was fairer than most. She did not bother to explain my presence, and itwas several weeks before the bazaar people learned something of my origins.Aunt Mariam, my mother’s younger sister, was at that time about 30. She camefrom a family of Christian converts, originally Muslims of Rampur. My mother hadmarried an Englishman, who died while I was still a baby, she herself was not astrong woman, and fought a losing battle with tuberculosis while bringing me up.My sixth birthday was approaching when she died, in the middle of the night,without my being aware of it, and I woke up to experience, for a day, all the terrorsof abandonment.But that same evening Aunt Mariam arrived. Her warmth, worldliness andcarefree chatter gave me the reassurance I needed so badly. She slept beside me thatnight and next morning, after the funeral, took me with her to her rooms in thebazaar. This small flat was to be my home for the next year-and-a-half.Before my mother’s death I had seen very little of my aunt. From the remarks Ioccasionally overheard, it appeared that Aunt Mariam had, in some indefinable way,disgraced the family. My mother was cold towards her, and I could not helpwondering why because a more friendly and cheerful extrovert than Aunt Mariamcould hardly be encountered.There were other relatives, but they did not come to my rescue with the samereadiness. It was only later, when the financial issues became clearer, thatinnumerable uncle and aunts appeared on the scene. The age of six is the beginning of an interesting period in the life of a day, andthe months I spent with Aunt Mariam are not difficult to recall. She was a joyous,bubbling creature — a force of nature rather than a woman — and every time I thinkof her I am tempted to put down on paper some aspect of her conversation, or hergestures, or her magnificent physique.She was a strong woman, taller than most men in the bazaar, but this did notdetract from her charms. Her voice was warm and deep, her face was a happy one,broad and unlined, and her teeth gleamed white in the dark brilliance of hercomplexion.She had large soft breasts, long arms and broad thighs. She was majestic, and atthe same time she was graceful. Above all, she was warm and full of understanding,and it was this tenderness of hers that overcame resentment and jealousy in otherwomen.She called me Ladla, her darling, and told me she had always wanted to look afterme. She had never married. I did not, at that age, ponder the reasons for her singlestate. At six, I took all things for granted and accepted Mariam for what she was —my benefactress and guardian angel.Her rooms were untidy compared with the neatness of my mother’s house.Mariam reveled in untidiness. I soon grew accustomed to the topsy-turviness of herrooms and found them comfortable. Beds (hers a very large and soft one) wereusually left unmade, while clothes lay draped over chairs and tables.A large watercolour hung on a wall, but Mariam’s bodice and knickers wereusually suspended from it, and I cannot recall the subject of the painting. Thedressing table was a fascinating place, crowded with all kinds of lotions, mascaras,paints, oil and ointments.Mariam would spend much time sitting in front of the mirror running a combthrough her long black hair, or preferably having young Mulia, a servant girl, combit for her. Though a Christian, my aunt retained several Muslim superstitions, andnever went into the open with her hair falling loose.Once Mulia came into the rooms with her own hair open. ‘You ought not to leaveyour hair open. Better knot it,’ said Aunt Mariam.‘But I have not yet oiled it, Aunty,’ replied Mulia. ‘How can I put it up?’‘You are too young to understand. There are jinns — aerial spirits — who areeasily attracted by long hair and pretty black eyes like yours.’‘Do jinns visit human beings, Aunty?’ ‘Learned people say so. Though I have never seen a jinn myself, I have seen theeffect they can have on one.’‘Oh, do tell about them,’ said Mulia.‘Well, there was once a lovely girl like you, who had a wealth of black hair,’ saidMariam. ‘Quite unaccountably she fell ill, and in spite of every attention and the bestmedicines, she kept getting worse. She grew as thin as a whipping post, her beautydecayed, and all that remained of it till her dying day was her wonderful head ofhair.’It did not take me long to make friends in the Dilaram bazaar. At first I was anobject of curiosity, and when I came down to play in the street both women andchildren would examine me as though, I was a strange marine creature.‘How fair he is,’ observed Mulia.‘And how black his aunt,’ commented the washerman’s wife, whose face wasfiddled with the marks of smallpox.‘His skin is very smooth,’ pointed out Mulia, who took considerable pride inhaving been the first to see me at close quarters. She pinched my cheeks withobvious pleasure.‘His hair and eyes are black,’ remarked Mulia’s aging mother.‘Is it true that his father was an Englishman?’‘Mariam-bi says so,’ said Mulia. ‘She never lies.’‘True,’ said the washerman’s wife, ‘Whatever her faults — and they are many —she has never been known to lie.’My aunt’s other ‘faults’ were a deep mystery to me; nor did anyone try toenlighten me about them.Some nights she had me sleep with her, other nights (I often wondered why) shegave me a bed in an adjoining room, although I much preferred remaining with her— especially since, on cold January nights, she provided me with considerablewarmth.I would curl up into a ball just below her soft tummy. On the other side, behindher knees, slept Leila, an enchanting Siamese cat given to her by an Americanbusinessman whose house she would sometimes visit. Every night, before I fellasleep, Mariam would kiss me, very softly, on my closed eyelids. I never fell asleepuntil I had received this phantom kiss.At first I resented the nocturnal visitors that Aunt Mariam free-quently received,their arrival meant that I had to sleep in the spare room with Leila. But when I found that these people were impermanent creatures, mere ships that passed in the night, Ilearned to put up with them.I seldom saw those men, though occasionally I caught a glimpse of a beard or anexpensive waistcoat or white pyjamas. They did not interest me very much, though Idid have a vague idea that they provided Aunt Mariam with some sort of income,thus enabling her to look after me.Once, when one particular visitor was very drunk, Mariam had to force him outof the flat. I glimpsed this episode through a crack in the door. The man was big, butno match for Aunt Mariam.She thrust him out onto the landing, and then he lost his footing and wenttumbling downstairs. No damage was done, and the man called on Mariam again afew days later, very sober and contrite, and was re-admitted to my aunt’s favours.Aunt Mariam must have begun to worry about the effect these comings andgoings might have on me, because after a few months she began to makearrangements for sending me to a boarding school in the hills.I had not the slightest desire to go to school and raised many objections. We hadlong arguments in which she tried vainly to impress upon me the desirability ofreceiving an education.‘To make a living, my Ladla,’ she said, ‘you must have an education.’‘But you have no education,’ I said, ‘and you have no difficulty in making aliving!’Mariam threw up her arms in mock despair. ‘Ten years from now I will not beable to make such a living. Then who will support and help me? An illiterate youngfellow, or an educated gentleman? When I am old, my son, when I am old ...’Finally I succumbed to her arguments and agreed to go to a boarding school. Andwhen the time came for me to leave, both Aunt Mariam and I broke down and weptat the railway station.I hung out of the window as the train moved away from the platform, and sawMariam, her bosom heaving, being helped from the platform by Mulia and some ofour neighbours.My incarceration in a boarding school was made more unbearable by the absenceof any letters from Aunt Mariam. She could write little more than her name.I was looking forward to my winter holidays and my return to Aunt Mariam andthe Dilaram bazaar, but this was not to be. During my absence there had been somelitigation over my custody, and my father’s relatives claimed that Aunt Mariam wasnot a fit person to be a child’s guardian. And so when I left school, it was not to Aunt Mariam’s place that I was sent, but toa strange family living in a railway colony near Moradabad. I remained with theserelatives until I finished school, but that is a different story.I did not see Aunt Mariam again. The Dilaram bazaar and my beautiful aunt andthe Siamese cat all became part of the receding world of my childhood.I would often think of Mariam, but as time passed she became more remote andinaccessible in my memory. It was not until many years later, when I was a youngman, that I visited the Dilaram bazaar again. I knew from my foster parents that AuntMariam was dead. Her heart, it seemed, had always been weak.I was anxious to see the Dilaram bazaar and its residents again, but my visit was adisappointment. The place had disappeared; or rather, it had been swallowed up by agrowing city.It was lost in the complex of a much larger market which had sprung up to serve anew government colony. The older people had died, and the young ones had gone tocolleges or factories or offices in different towns. Aunt Mariam’s rooms had beenpulled down.I found her grave in the little cemetery on the town’s outskirts. One of her moredevoted admirers had provided a handsome gravestone, surmounted by a sculpturedangel. One of the wings had broken off, and the face was chipped, which gave theangel a slightly crooked smile.But in spite of the broken wing and the smile, it was a very ordinary stone angeland could not hold a candle to my Aunt Mariam, the very special guardian angel ofmy childhood.

13	Death of a Familiar	Before long I gave up asking him to return anything, just as I had given up askinghim to stop seeing me.Sunil was one of those people best loved from a distance. He was born with aspecial talent for trouble. I think it pleased his vanity when he was pursued by iratecreditors, shopkeepers, brothers whose sisters he had insulted, and husbands whosewives he had molested. My association with him did nothing to improve my ownreputation of Shahganj.My landlady, a protective, motherly, Punjabi widow, said: ‘Son, you are in badcompany. Do you know that Sunil has already been expelled from one school forstealing, and from another for sexual offences?’‘He’s only a boy,’ I said. ‘And he’s taking longer than most boys to grow up. Hedoesn’t realise the seriousness of what he does. He will learn as he grows older.’‘If he grows older,’ said my landlady darkly. ‘Do you know that he nearly killed aman last year? When a fruit-seller who had been cheated threatened to report Sunilto the police, he threw a brick at the man’s head. The poor man was in hospital forthree weeks. If Sunil’s father did not have political influence, the boy would be injail now, instead of climbing your stairs every afternoon.’Once again I suggested to Sunil that he come to see me less often.He looked hurt and offended.‘Don’t you like me any more?’‘I like you immensely. But I have work to do ...’‘I know. You think I am a crook. Well, I am a crook.’ He spoke with all theconfidence of a young man who has never been hurt or disillusioned; he hadromantic notions about swindlers and gangsters. ‘I’ll be a big crook one day, andpeople will be scared of me. But don’t worry, old boy, you’re my friend. I wouldn’tharm you in any way. In fact, I’ll protect you.’‘Thank you, but I don’t require protection, I want to be left alone. I have work,and you are a worry and a distraction.’‘Well, I’m not going to leave you alone,’ he said, assuming the posture of a spoiltchild. ‘Why should you be left alone? Who do you think you are? If we’re friendsnow, it’s your fault. I’m not going to buzz off just to suit your convenience.’‘Come less often, that’s all.’‘I’ll come more often, you old snob! I know, you’re thinking of your reputation— as if you had any. Well, you don’t have to worry, mon ami — as they say inHollywood. I’ll be very discreet, daddyji!’ Whenever I complained or became querulous, Sunil would call me daddy oruncle or sometimes mum, and make me feel more ridiculous. If he was in a goodmood, he would use the Hindi word chacha (uncle). All it did was to make me feelmuch older than my twenty-five years.Sunil turned up one afternoon with blood streaming from his nose and from agash across his forehead. He sat down at the foot of the bed, and began dabbling hisface with the bedsheet.‘What have you done to yourself?’ I asked in some alarm.‘Some fellows beat me up. There were three of them. They followed me on theircycles.’‘Who were they?’ I asked, looking for iodine on the dressing-table.‘Just some fellows ...’‘They must have had a reason.’‘Well, a sister of one of them had been talking to me.’‘Well, that isn’t a reason, even in Shahganj. You must have said or donesomething to offend her.’‘No, she likes me,’ he said, wincing as I dabbed iodine on his forehead ‘We wentto the guava orchard near my uncle’s farm.’‘She went out there alone with you?’‘Sure. I took her on my bike. They must have followed us. Anyway, we weren’tdoing much except kissing and fooling around. But some people seem to think that’sworse than ...’Both he and the other boys of Shahganj had grown up to look upon girls asstrange, exotic animals, who must be seized at the first opportunity. Experimentingin sex was like playing a surreptitious game of marbles.Sunil produced a clasp-knife from his pocket, opened it, and held the bladeagainst the flat of his hand.‘Don’t worry, uncle, I can look after myself. The next fellow who tries tointerfere with me will get this in his guts.’‘Don’t be silly,’ I said. ‘You will go to prison for ten years. Listen, I’m going upto Simla for a couple of weeks, just for a change. Why don’t you come with me? Itwill be a pleasant change from Shahganj, and in the meantime all this fuss will diedown.’It was one of those invitations which I make so readily and instantly regret. Assoon as I had made the suggestion, I realised that Sunil in Simla might be even moreof a problem than Sunil in Shahganj. But it was too late for me to back out. ‘Simla! Why not? The college is closing for the summer holidays, and my fatherwon’t mind my going with you. He believes you’re the only respectable friend I’vegot. Boy! we’ll have a good time in Simla.’‘You’ll have to behave yourself there, if you want to come with me. No girls,Sunil.’‘No girls, sir. I’ll be very good, chachaji. Please take me to Simla.’‘I think two hundred rupees should be enough for a fortnight for both of us,’ Isaid.‘Oh, too much,’ said Sunil modestly.And a week later we were actually in Simla, putting up at a moderately priced,middle-class hotel.Our first few days in the hill-station were pleasant enough. We went for longwalks, tired ourselves out, and acquired enormous appetites. Sunil, in the hills forthe first time in his life, declared that they were wonderful, and thanked me a scoreof times for bringing him up. He took a genuine interest in exploring remotevalleys, forests and waterfalls, and seemed to be losing some of his self-centredness. I believe that mountains do affect one’s personality, if one can remainamong them long enough; and if Sunil had grown up in the hills instead of in arefugee township, I have no doubt he would have been a completely differentperson.There was one small waterfall I rather liked. It was down a ravine, in a ratherinaccessible spot, where very few people ever went. The water fell about thirty feetinto a small pool. We bathed here on two occasions, and Sunil quite forgot theattractions of the town. And we would have visited the spot again had I not slippedand sprained my ankle. This accident confined me to the hotel balcony for severaldays, and I was afraid that Sunil, for want of companionship, would go in search ofmore mundane distractions. But though he went out often enough, he came backdusty and sunburnt; and the fact that he asked me for very little money was evidenceenough of his fondness for the outdoors. Striding through forests of oak and pine,with all the world stretched out far below, was no doubt a new and exhilaratingexperience for him. But how long would it be before the spell was broken?‘Don’t you need any money?’ I asked him uneasily, on the third day of hisThoreau-like activities.‘What for, uncle? Fresh air costs nothing. And besides, I don’t owe money toanyone in Simla. We haven’t been here long enough.’‘Then perhaps we should be going,’ I said. ‘Shahganj is a miserable little dump.’‘I know, but it’s your home. And for the time being, it’s mine.’‘Listen, uncle,’ he said, after a moment of reflection. ‘Yesterday, on one of mywalks, I met a school-teacher. She’s over thirty, so don’t get nervous. She doesn’thave any brothers or relatives who will come chasing after me. And she’s muchfairer than you, uncle. Is it all right if I’m friendly with her?’‘I suppose so,’ I said uncertainly. School teachers can usually take care ofthemselves (if they want to), and, besides, an older woman might have had asobering influence on Sunil.He brought her over to see me that same evening, and seemed quite proud of hisnew acquisition. She was indeed fair, perhaps insipidly so, with blonde hair and lightblue eyes. She had a young face and a healthy body, but her voice was peculiarlytoneless and flat, giving an impression of boredom, of lassitude. I wondered whatshe found attractive in Sunil apart from his obvious animal charm. They had hardlyanything in common; but perhaps the absence of similar interests was an attractionin itself. In six or seven years of teaching Maureen must have been tired of the usualscholastic types. Sunil was refreshingly free from all classroom associations.Maureen let her hair down at the first opportunity. She switched on the bedroomradio and found Ceylon. Soon she was teaching Sunil to dance. This was amusing,because Sunil, with his long legs, had great difficulty in taking small steps; norcould Maureen cope with his great strides. But he was very earnest about it all, andinserting an unlighted cigarette between his lips, did his best to move rhythmicallyaround the bedroom. I think he was convinced that by learning to dance he wouldreach the high-water mark of western culture. Maureen stood for all that was remoteand romantic, and for all the films that he had seen. To conquer her would, forSunil, be a voyage of discovery, not a mere gratification of his senses. And forMaureen, this new unconventional friendship must have been a refreshing diversionfrom the dreariness of her school routine. She was old enough to realise that it wasonly a diversion. The intensity of emotional attachments had faded with her earlyyouth, and love could wound her heart no more. But for Sunil, it was only thebeginning of something that stirred him deeply, moved him inexorably towardsmanhood.It was unfortunate that I did not then notice this subtle change in my friend. I hadknown him only as a shallow creature, and was certain that this new infatuationwould disappear as soon as the novelty of it wore off. As Maureen had no encumbrances, no relations that she would speak of, I saw no harm in encouragingthe friendship and seeing how it would develop.‘I think we’d better have something to drink,’ I said, and ringing the bell for theroom-bearer, ordered several bottles of beer.Sunil gave me an odd, whimsical look. I had never before encouraged him todrink. But he did not hesitate to open the bottles; and, before long, Maureen and hewere drinking from the same glass.‘Let’s make love,’ said Sunil, putting his arm round Maureen’s shoulders andgazing adoringly into her dreamy blue eyes.They seemed unconcerned by my presence; but I was embarrassed, and gettingup, said I would be going for a walk.‘Enjoy yourself,’ said Sunil, winking at me over Maureen’s shoulder.‘You ought to get yourself a girl friend,’ said the young woman in a conciliatorytone.‘True,’ I said, and moved guiltily out of the room I was paying for.Our stay in Simla lasted several days longer than we had planned. I saw little ofSunil and Maureen during this time. As Sunil had no desire to return to Shahganjany earlier than was absolutely necessary, he avoided me during the day; but Imanaged to stay awake late enough one night to confront him when he crept quietlyinto the room.‘Dear friend and familiar,’ I said. ‘I hate to spoil your beautiful romance, but Ihave absolutely no money left, and unless you have resources of your own — or ifMaureen can support you — I suggest that you accompany me back to Shahganj theday after tomorrow.’‘How mean you are, chachaji. This is something serious. I mean Maureen andme. Do you think we should get married?’‘No.’‘But why not?’‘Because she cannot support you on a teacher’s salary. And she probably isn’tinterested in a permanent relationship — like ours.’‘Very funny. And you think I’d let my wife slave for me?’‘I do. And besides ...’‘And besides,’ he interrupted, grinning, ‘she’s old enough to be my mother.’‘Are you really in love with her?’ I asked him. ‘I’ve never known you to beserious about anything.’‘Honestly, uncle.’ ‘And what about her?’‘Oh, she loves me terribly, really she does. She’s ready to come down with us ifit’s possible. Only I’ve told her that I’ll first have to break the news to my father,otherwise he might kick me out of the house.’‘Well, then,’ I said shrewdly, ‘the sooner we return to Shahganj and get yourfather’s blessings, the sooner you and Maureen can get married, if that’s what bothof you really want.’Early next morning Sunil disappeared, and I knew he would be gone all day. Myfoot was better, and I decided to take a walk on my own to the waterfall I had likedso much. It was almost noon when I reached the spot and began descending the steeppath to the ravine. The stream was hidden by dense foliage, giant ferns and dahlias,but the water made a tremendous noise as it tumbled over the rocks. When I reacheda sharp promontory, I was able to look down on the pool. Two people were lying onthe grass.I did not recognise them at first. They looked very beautiful together, and I hadnot expected Sunil and Maureen to look so beautiful. Sunil, on whom no surplusflesh had as yet gathered, possessed all the sinuous grace and power of a youngGod; and the woman, her white flesh pressed against young grass, reminded me of apainting by Titian that I had seen in a gallery in Florence. Her full, mature body wastouched with a tranquil intoxication, her breasts rose and fell slowly, and waves ofmuscle merged into the shadows of her broad thighs. It was as though I hadstumbled into another age, and had found two lovers in a forest glade. Only a foolwould have wished to disturb them. Sunil had for once in his life risen abovemediocrity, and I hurried away before the magic was lost.The human voice often shatters the beauty of the most tender passions; and whenwe left Simla next day, and Maureen and Sunil used all the stock cliches to expresstheir love, I was a little disappointed. But the poetry of life was in their bodies, not intheir tongues.Back in Shahganj, Sunil actually plucked up courage to speak to his father. This,to me, was a sign that he took the affair very seriously, for he seldom approachedhis father for anything. But all the sympathy that he received was a box on the ears. Ireceived a curt note suggesting that I was having a corrupting influence on the boyand that I should stop seeing him. There was little I could do in the matter, because ithad always been Sunil who had insisted on seeing me.He continued to visit me, bring me Maureen’s letters (strange, how lovers cannotbear that the world should not know their love), and his own to her, so that I could correct his English!It was at about this time that Sunil began speaking to me about his uncle’s paperfactory, and the possibility of working in it. Once he was getting a salary, he pointedout, Maureen would be able to leave her job and join him.Unfortunately Sunil’s decision to join the paper factory took months to crystalliseinto a definite course of action, and in the meantime he was finding a panacea forlove-sickness in rum and sometimes cheap country spirits. The money that he nowborrowed was used not to pay his debts, or to incur new ones, but to drink himselfsilly. I regretted having been the first person to have offered him a drink: I shouldhave known that Sunil was a person who could do nothing in moderation.He pestered me less often now, but the purpose of his occasional visits became alltoo obvious. I was having a little success, and thoughtlessly gave Sunil the fewrupees he usually demanded. At the same time I was beginning to find other friends,and I no longer found myself worrying about Sunil, as I had so often done in thepast. Perhaps this was treachery on my part ...When finally I decided to leave Shahganj for Delhi. I went in search of Sunil tosay goodbye. I found him in a small bar, alone at a table with a bottle of rum.Though barely twenty, he no longer looked a boy. He was a completely differentperson from the handsome, cocksure youth I had met at the wrestling-pit a yearpreviously. His cheeks were hollow and he had not shaved for days. I knew thatwhen I had first met him he had been without scruples, a shallow youth, the productof many circumstances. He was no longer so shallow and he had stumbled uponlove, but his character was too weak to sustain the weight of disillusionment.Perhaps I should have left him severely alone from the beginning. Before me sat aruin, and I had helped to undermine the foundations. None of us can really avoidseeing the outcome of our smallest actions ...‘I’m off to Delhi, Sunil.’He did not look up from the table.‘Have a good time,’ he said.‘Have you heard from Maureen?’ I asked, certain that he had not.He nodded, but for once he did not offer to show me the letter.‘What’s wrong?’ I asked.‘Oh, nothing,’ he said, looking up and forcing a smile. ‘These dames are all thesame, uncle. We shouldn’t take them too seriously, you know.’‘Why, what has she done, got married to someone else?’‘Yes,’ he said scornfully. ‘To a bloody teacher.’ ‘Well, she wasn’t young,’ I said. ‘She couldn’t wait for you for ever, I suppose.’‘She could if she had really loved me. But there’s no such thing as love, is there,uncle?’I made no reply. Had he really broken his heart over a woman? Were there, withinhim, unsuspected depths of feeling and passion? You find love when you leastexpect to; and lose it, when you are sure that it is in your grasp.‘You’re a lucky beggar,’ he said. ‘You’re a philosopher. You find a reason forevery stupid thing, and so you are able to ignore all stupidity.’I laughed. ‘You’re becoming a philosopher yourself. But don’t think too hard,Sunil, you might find it painful.’‘Not I, chachaji,’ he said, emptying his glass. ‘I’m not going to think. I’m goingto work in a paper factory. I shall become respectable. What an adventure that willbe!’And that was the last time I saw Sunil.He did not become respectable. He was still searching like a great discoverer forsomething new, someone different, when he met his pitiful end in the cold rain of aDecember night.Though murder cases usually get reported in the papers, Sunil was a person ofsuch little importance that his violent end was not considered newsworthy. It wentunnoticed, and Maureen could not have known about it. The case has already beenforgotten, for in the great human mass that is India, hundreds of people disappearevery day and are never heard of again. Sunil will be quickly forgotten by all exceptthose to whom he owed money. 	Aakanksha	2018		RH
14	The Kitemaker	There was but one tree in the street known as Gali Ram Nath — an ancient banyanthat had grown through the cracks of an abandoned mosque — and little Ali’s kitehad caught in its branches. The boy, barefoot and clad only in a torn shirt, ran alongthe cobbled stones of the narrow street to where his grandfather sat noddingdreamily in the sunshine of their back courtyard.‘Grandfather,’ shouted the boy. ‘My kite has gone!’The old man woke from his daydream with a start, and raising his head, displayeda beard that would have been white, had it not been dyed red with mehndi leaves.‘Did the twine break?’ he asked. ‘I know that kite twine is not what it used to be.’‘No, grandfather, the kite is stuck in the banyan tree.’The old man chuckled. ‘You have yet to learn how to fly a kite properly, my child.And I am too old to teach you, that’s the pity of it. But you shall have another.’He had just finished making a new kite from bamboo paper and thin silk, and itlay in the sun, firming up. It was a pale pink kite, with a small green tail. The oldman handed it to Ali, and the boy raised himself on his toes and kissed hisgrandfather’s hollowed-out cheek.‘I will not lose this one,’ he said. ‘This kite will fly like a bird.’ And he turned onhis heels and skipped out of the courtyard.The old man remained dreaming in the sun. His kite shop was gone, the premiseslong since sold to a junk dealer; but he still made kites, for his own amusement andfor the benefit of his grandson, Ali. Not many people bought kites these days. Adultsdisdained them, and children preferred to spend their money at the cinema.Moreover, there were not many open spaces left for the flying of kites. The city hadswallowed up the open grassland that had stretched from the old fort’s walls to theriver bank.But the old man remembered a time when grown men flew kites, and great battleswere fought, the kites swerving and swooping in the sky, tangling with each other until the string of one was severed. Then the defeated but liberated kite would floataway into the blue unknown. There was a good deal of betting, and moneyfrequently changed hands.Kite-flying was then the sport of kings, and the old man remembered how theNawab himself would come down to the riverside with his retinue to participate inthis noble pastime. There was time, then, to spend an idle hour with a gay, dancingstrip of paper. Now everyone hurried, hurried in a heat of hope, and delicate thingslike kites and daydreams were trampled underfoot.He, Mehmood the kite-maker, had in the prime of his life been well-knownthroughout the city. Some of his more elaborate kites once sold for as much as threeor four rupees each.At the request of the Nawab he had once made a very special kind of kite, unlikeany that had been seen in the district. It consisted of a series of small, very lightpaper disks, trailing on a thin bamboo frame. To the end of each disk he fixed asprig of grass, forming a balance on both sides.The surface of the foremost disk was slightly convex, and a fantastic face waspainted on it, having two eyes made of small mirrors. The disks, decreasing in sizefrom head to tail, assumed an undulatory form, and gave the kite the appearance of acrawling serpent. It required great skill to raise this cumbersome device from theground, and only Mehmood could manage it.Everyone had heard of the ‘Dragon Kite’ that Mehmood had built, and word wentround that it possessed supernatural powers. A large crowd assembled in the open towatch its first public launching in the presence of the Nawab.At the first attempt it refused to leave the ground.The disks made a plaintive, protesting sound, and the sun was trapped in the littlemirrors, and made of the kite a living, complaining creature. And then the windcame from the right direction, and the Dragon Kite soared into the sky, wrigglingits way higher and higher, with the sun still glinting in its devil-eyes. And when itwent very high, it pulled fiercely on the twine, and Mehmood’s young sons had tohelp him with the reel; but still the kite pulled, determined to be free, to break loose,to live a life of its own. And eventually it did so.The twine snapped, the kite leaped away toward the sun, sailed on heavenwarduntil it was lost to view. It was never found again, and Mehmood wonderedafterwards if he had made too vivid, too living a thing of the great kite. He did notmake another like it, and instead he presented to the Nawab a musical kite, one thatmade a sound like a violin when it rose in the air. Those were more leisurely, more spacious days. But the Nawab had died yearsago, and his descendants were almost as poor as Mehmood himself. Kite-makers,like poets, once had their patrons; but no one knew Mehmood, simply because therewere too many people in the Gali, and they could not be bothered with theirneighbours.When Mehmood was younger and had fallen sick, everyone in theneighbourhood had come to ask after his health; but now, when his days weredrawing to a close, no one visited him. True, most of his old friends were dead andhis sons had grown up: one was working in a local garage, the other had been inPakistan at the time of Partition and had not been able to rejoin his relatives.The children who had bought kites from him 10 years ago were now grown men,struggling for a living; they did not have time for the old man and his memories.They had grown up in a swiftly changing and competitive world, and they looked atthe old kite-maker and the banyan tree with the same indifference.Both were taken for granted — permanent fixtures that were of no concern to theraucous, sweating mass of humanity that surrounded them. No longer did peoplegather under the banyan tree to discuss their problems and their plans: only in thesummer months did a few seek shelter from the fierce sun.But there was the boy, his grandson; it was good that Mehmood’s son workedclose by, for it gladdened the old man’s heart to watch the small boy at play in thewinter sunshine, growing under his eyes like a young and well-nourished saplingputting forth new leaves each day. There is a great affinity between trees and men.We grow at much the same pace, if we are not hurt or starved or cut down. In ouryouth we are resplendent creatures, and in our declining years we stoop a little, weremember, we, stretch our brittle limbs in the sun, and then, with a sigh, we shed ourlast leaves.Mehmood was like the banyan, his hands gnarled and twisted like the roots of theancient tree. Ali was like the young mimosa planted at the end of the courtyard. Intwo years both he and the tree would acquire the strength and confidence of theirearly youth.The voices in the street grew fainter, and Mehmood wondered if he was going tofall asleep and dream, as he so often did, of a kite so beautiful and powerful that itwould resemble the great white bird of the Hindus, Garuda, God Vishnu’s famoussteed. He would like to make a wonderful new kite for little Ali. He had nothing elseto leave the boy. He heard Ali’s voice in the distance, but did not realise that the boy was callinghim. The voice seemed to come from very far away.Ali was at the courtyard door, asking if his mother had as yet returned from thebazaar. When Mehmood did not answer, the boy came forward repeating hisquestion. The sunlight was slanting across the old man’s head, and a small whitebutterfly rested on his flowing beard. Mehmood was silent; and when Ali put hissmall brown hand on the old man’s shoulder, he met with no response. The boyheard a faint sound, like the rubbing of marbles in his pocket.Suddenly afraid, Ali turned and moved to the door, and then ran down the streetshouting for his mother. The butterfly left the old man’s beard and flew to themimosa tree, and a sudden gust of wind caught the torn kite and lifted it into the air,carrying it far above the struggling city into the blind blue sky.

15	The Monkeys	 I couldn’t be sure, next morning, if I had been dreaming or if I had really hearddogs barking in the night and had seen them scampering about on the hillside belowthe cottage. There had been a Golden Cocker, a Retriever, a Peke, a Dachshund, ablack Labrador, and one or two nondescripts. They had woken me with theirbarking shortly after midnight, and made so much noise that I got out of bed andlooked out of the open window. I saw them quite plainly in the moonlight, five orsix dogs rushing excitedly through the bracket and long monsoon grass.It was only because there had been so many breeds among the dogs that I felt alittle confused. I had been in the cottage only a week, and I was already on noddingor speaking terms with most of my neighbours. Colonel Fanshawe, retired from theIndian Army, was my immediate neighbour. He did keep a Cocker, but it was black.The elderly Anglo-Indian spinsters who lived beyond the deodars kept only cats.(Though why cats should be the prerogative of spinsters, I have never been able tounderstand.) The milkman kept a couple of mongrels. And the Punjabi industrialistwho had bought a former prince’s palace — without ever occupying it — left theproperty in charge of a watchman who kept a huge Tibetan mastiff.None of these dogs looked like the ones I had seen in the night.‘Does anyone here keep a Retriever?’ I asked Colonel Fanshawe, when I met himtaking his evening walk.‘No one that I know of,’ he said, and he gave me a swift, penetrating look fromunder his bushy eyebrows. ‘Why, have you seen one around?’‘No, I just wondered. There are a lot of dogs in the area, aren’t there?’‘Oh, yes. Nearly everyone keeps a dog here. Of course every now and then apanther carries one off. Lost a lovely little terrier myself, only last winter.’Colonel Fanshawe, tall and red-faced, seemed to be waiting for me to tell himsomething more — or was he just taking time to recover his breath after a stiffuphill climb? That night I heard the dogs again. I went to the window and looked out. The moonwas at the full, silvering the leaves of the oak trees.The dogs were looking up into the trees, and barking. But I could see nothing inthe trees, not even an owl.I gave a shout, and the dogs disappeared into the forest.Colonel Fanshawe looked at me expectantly when I met him the following day. Heknew something about those dogs, of that I was certain; but he was waiting to hearwhat I had to say. I decided to oblige him.‘I saw at least six dogs in the middle of the night,’ I said. ‘A Cocker, a Retriever, aPeke, a Dachshund, and two mongrels. Now, Colonel, I’m sure you must knowwhose they are.’The Colonel was delighted. I could tell by the way his eyes glinted that he wasgoing to enjoy himself at my expense.‘You’ve been seeing Miss. Fairchild’s dogs,’ he said with smug satisfaction.‘Oh, and where does she live?’‘She doesn’t, my boy. Died fifteen years ago.’‘Then what are her dogs doing here?’‘Looking for monkeys,’ said the Colonel. And he stood back to watch myreactions.‘I’m afraid I don’t understand,’ I said.‘Let me put it this way,’ said the Colonel. ‘Do you believe in ghosts?’‘I’ve never seen any,’ I said.‘But you have, my boy, you have. Miss. Fairchild’s dogs died years ago — aCocker, a Retriever, a Dachshund, a Peke, and two mongrels. They were buried on alittle knoll under the oaks. Nothing odd about their deaths, mind you. They were allquite old, and didn’t survive their mistress very long. Neighbours looked after themuntil they died.’‘And Miss. Fairchild lived in the cottage where I stay? Was she young?’‘She was in her mid-forties, an athletic sort of woman, fond of the outdoors.Didn’t care much for men. I thought you knew about her.’‘No, I haven’t been here very long, you know. But what was it you said aboutmonkeys? Why were the dogs looking for monkeys?’‘Ah, that’s the interesting part of the story. Have you seen the langur monkeys thatsometimes come to eat oak leaves?’‘No.’ ‘You will, sooner or later. There has always been a band of them roaming theseforests. They’re quite harmless really, except that they’ll ruin a garden if given halfa chance ... Well, Miss. Fairchild fairly loathed those monkeys. She was very keenon her dahlias — grew some prize specimens — but the monkeys would come atnight, dig up the plants, and eat the dahlia-bulbs. Apparently they found the bulbsmuch to their liking. Miss. Fairchild would be furious. People who are passionatelyfond of gardening often go off balance when their best plants are ruined — that’sonly human, I suppose. Miss. Fairchild set her dogs at the monkeys, whenever shecould, even if it was in the middle of the night. But the monkeys simply took to thetrees and left the dogs barking.’‘Then one day — or rather, one night — Miss. Fairchild took desperate measures.She borrowed a shotgun, and sat up near a window. And when the monkeys arrived,she shot one of them dead.’The Colonel paused and looked out over the oak trees which were shimmering inthe warm afternoon sun.‘She shouldn’t have done that,’ he said.‘Never shoot a monkey. It’s not only that they’re sacred to Hindus — but they arerather human, you know. Well, I must be getting on. Good-day!’ And the Colonel,having ended his story rather abruptly, set off at a brisk pace through the deodars.I didn’t hear the dogs that night. But next day I saw the monkeys — the real ones,not ghosts. There were about twenty of them, young and old, sitting in the treesmunching oak leaves. They didn’t pay much attention to me, and I watched them forsome time.They were handsome creatures, their fur a silver-grey, their tails long andsinuous. They leapt gracefully from tree to tree, and were very polite and dignifiedin their behaviour towards each other — unlike the bold, rather crude red monkeysof the plains. Some of the younger ones scampered about on the hillside, playingand wrestling with each other like schoolboys.There were no dogs to molest them — and no dahlias to tempt them into thegarden.But that night, I heard the dogs again. They were barking more furiously thanever.‘Well, I’m not getting up for them this time’ I mumbled, and pulled the blanketsover my ears.But the barking grew louder, and was joined by other sounds, a squealing and ascuffling. Then suddenly the piercing shriek of a woman rang through the forest. It was anunearthly sound, and it made my hair stand up.I leapt out of bed and dashed to the window.A woman was lying on the ground, and three or four huge monkeys were on topof her, biting her arms and pulling at her throat. The dogs were yelping and tryingto drag the monkeys off, but they were being harried from behind by others. Thewoman gave another bloodcurdling shriek, and I dashed back into the room,grabbed hold of a small axe, and ran into the garden.But everyone — dogs, monkeys and shrieking woman — had disappeared, and Istood alone on the hillside in my pyjamas, clutching an axe and feeling very foolish.The Colonel greeted me effusively the following day.‘Still seeing those dogs?’ he asked in a bantering tone.‘I’ve seen the monkeys too,’ I said.‘Oh, yes, they’ve come around again. But they’re real enough, and quiteharmless.’‘I know — but I saw them last night with the dogs.’‘Oh, did you really? That’s strange, very strange.’The Colonel tried to avoid my eye, but I hadn’t quite finished with him.‘Colonel,’ I said. ‘You never did get around to telling me how Miss. Fairchilddied.’‘Oh, didn’t I? Must have slipped my memory. I’m getting old, don’t rememberpeople as well as I used to. But of course I remember about Miss. Fairchild, poorlady. The monkeys killed her. Didn’t you know? They simply tore her to pieces ...’His voice trailed off, and he looked thoughtfully at a caterpillar that was makingits way up his walking-stick.‘She shouldn’t have shot one of them,’ he said. ‘Never shoot a monkey — they’rerather human, you know ...’  	Aakanksha	2018		RH
16	The Prospect of Flowers 	Fern Hill, The Oaks, Hunter’s Lodge, The Parsonage, The Pines, Dumbarnie,Mackinnon’s Hall and Windermere. These are the names of some of the old housesthat still stand on the outskirts of one of the smaller Indian hill stations. Most ofthem have fallen into decay and ruin. They are very old, of course — built over ahundred years ago by Britishers who sought relief from the searing heat of theplains. Today’s visitors to the hill stations prefer to live near the markets andcinemas and many of the old houses, set amidst oak and maple and deodar, areinhabited by wild cats, bandicoots, owls, goats, and the occasional charcoal-burneror mule-driver.But amongst these neglected mansions stands a neat, whitewashed cottage calledMulberry Lodge. And in it, up to a short time ago, lived an elderly English spinsternamed Miss. Mackenzie.In years Miss Mackenzie was more than ‘elderly,’ being well over eighty. But noone would have guessed it. She was clean, sprightly, and wore old-fashioned butwell-preserved dresses. Once a week, she walked the two miles to town to buy butterand jam and soap and sometimes a small bottle of eau-de-Col’ogne.She had lived in the hill station since she had been a girl in her teens, and that hadbeen before the First World War. Though she had never married, she hadexperienced a few love affairs and was far from being the typical frustrated spinsterof fiction. Her parents had been dead thirty years; her brother and sister were alsodead. She had no relatives in India, and she lived on a small pension of forty rupeesa month and the gift parcels that were sent out to her from New Zealand by a friendof her youth.Like other lonely old people, she kept a pet, a large black cat with bright yelloweyes. In her small garden she grew dahlias, chrysanthemums, gladioli and a few rareorchids. She knew a great deal about plants, and about wild flowers, trees, birds andinsects. She had never made a serious study of these things, but, having lived with them for so many years, had developed an intimacy with all that grew andflourished around her.She had few visitors. Occasionally the padre from the local church called on her,and once a month the postman came with a letter from New Zealand or her pensionpapers. The milkman called every second day with a litre of milk for the lady andher cat. And sometimes she received a couple of eggs free, for the egg-sellerremembered a time when Miss. Mackenzie, in her earlier prosperity, bought eggsfrom him in large quantities. He was a sentimental man. He remembered her whenshe was a ravishing beauty in her twenties and he had gazed at her in round-eyed,nine-year-old wonder and consternation.Now it was September and the rains were nearly over and Miss. Mackenzie’schrysanthemums were coming into their own. She hoped the coming winterwouldn’t be too severe because she found it increasingly difficult to bear the cold.One day, as she was pottering about in her garden, she saw a schoolboy pluckingwild flowers on the slope about the cottage.‘Who’s that?’ she called. ‘What are you up to, young man?’The boy was alarmed and tried to dash up the hillside, but he slipped on pineneedles and came slithering down the slope into Miss. Mackenzie’s nasturtium bed.When he found there was no escape, he gave a bright disarming smile and said,‘Good morning, Miss.’He belonged to the local English-medium school, and wore a bright red blazerand a red-and-black-striped tie. Like most polite Indian schoolboys, he called everywoman ‘Miss.’‘Good morning,’ said Miss. Mackenzie severely. ‘Would you mind moving out ofmy flower-bed?’The boy stepped gingerly over the nasturtiums and looked up at Miss. Mackenziewith dimpled cheeks and appealing eyes. It was impossible to be angry with him.‘You’re trespassing,’ said Miss Mackenzie.‘Yes, Miss.’‘And you ought to be in school at this hour.’‘Yes, Miss.’‘Then what are you doing here?’‘Picking flowers, Miss.’ And he held up a bunch of ferns and wild flowers.‘Oh,’ Miss Mackenzie was disarmed. It was a long time since she had seen a boytaking an interest in flowers, and, what was more, playing truant from school inorder to gather them. ‘Do you like flowers?’ she asked.‘Yes, Miss. I’m going to be a botan — a botantist?’‘You mean a botanist.’‘Yes, Miss.’‘Well, that’s unusual. Most boys at your age want to be pilots or soldiers orperhaps engineers. But you want to be a botanist. Well, well. There’s still hope forthe world, I see. And do you know the names of these flowers?’‘This is a Bukhilo flower,’ he said, showing her a small golden flower. ‘That’s aPahari name. It means Puja, or prayer. The flower is offered during prayers. But Idon’t know what this is ...’He held out a pale pink flower with a soft, heart-shaped leaf.‘It’s a wild begonia,’ said Miss Mackenzie. ‘And that purple stuff is salvia, but itisn’t wild, it’s a plant that escaped from my garden. Don’t you have any books onflowers?’‘No, Miss.’‘All right, come in and I’ll show you a book.’She led the boy into a small front room, which was crowded with furniture andbooks and vases and jam-jars, and offered him a chair. He sat awkwardly on itsedge. The black cat immediately leapt on to his knees, and settled down on them,purring loudly.‘What’s your name?’ asked Miss Mackenzie, as she rummaged among her books.‘Anil, Miss.’‘And where do you live?’‘When school closes, I go to Delhi. My father has a business.’‘Oh, and what’s that?’‘Bulbs, Miss.’‘Flower bulbs?’‘No, electric bulbs.’‘Electric bulbs! You might send me a few, when you get home. Mine are alwaysfusing, and they’re so expensive, like everything else these days. Ah, here we are!’She pulled a heavy volume down from the shelf and laid it on the table. ‘FloraHimaliensis, published in 1892, and probably the only copy in India. This is a veryvaluable book, Anil. No other naturalist has recorded so many wild Himalayanflowers. And let me tell you this, there are many flowers and plants which are stillunknown to the fancy botanists who spend all their time at microscopes instead of inthe mountains. But perhaps, you’ll do something about that, one day.’ ‘Yes, Miss.’They went through the book together, and Miss. Mackenzie pointed out manyflowers that grew in and around the hill station, while the boy made notes of theirnames and seasons. She lit a stove, and put the kettle on for tea. And then the oldEnglish lady and the small Indian boy sat side by side over cups of hot sweet tea,absorbed in a book of wild flowers.‘May I come again?’ asked Anil, when finally he rose to go.‘If you like,’ said Miss Mackenzie. ‘But not during school hours. You mustn’tmiss your classes.’After that, Anil visited Miss. Mackenzie about once a week, and nearly always hebrought a wildflower for her to identify. She found herself looking forward to theboy’s visits — and sometimes, when more than a week passed and he didn’t come,she was disappointed and lonely and would grumble at the black cat.Anil reminded her of her brother, when the latter had been a boy. There was nophysical resemblance. Andrew had been fair-haired and blue-eyed. But it was Anil’seagerness, his alert bright look and the way he stood — legs apart, hands on hips, apicture of confidence — that reminded her of the boy who had shared her ownyouth in these same hills.And why did Anil come to see her so often?Partly because she knew about wild flowers, and he really did want to become abotanist. And partly because she smelt of freshly baked bread, and that was a smellhis own grandmother had possessed. And partly because she was lonely andsometimes a boy of twelve can sense loneliness better than an adult. And partlybecause he was a little different from other children.By the middle of October, when there was only a fortnight left for the school toclose, the first snow had fallen on the distant mountains. One peak stood high abovethe rest, a white pinnacle against the azure-blue sky. When the sun set, this peakturned from orange to gold to pink to red.‘How high is that mountain?’ asked Anil.‘It must be over 12,000 feet,’ said Miss. Mackenzie. ‘About thirty miles from her,as the crow flies. I always wanted to go there, but there was no proper road. At thatheight, there’ll be flowers that you don’t get here — the blue gentian and the purplecolumbine, the anemone and the edelweiss.’‘I’ll go there one day,’ said Anil.‘I’m sure you will, if you really want to.’The day before his school closed, Anil came to say goodbye to Miss. Mackenzie. ‘I don’t suppose you’ll be able to find many wild flowers in Delhi,’ she said. ‘Buthave a good holiday.’‘Thank you, Miss.’As he was about to leave, Miss Mackenzie, on an impulse, thrust the FloraHimaliensis into his hands.‘You keep it,’ she said. ‘It’s a present for you.’‘But I’ll be back next year, and I’ll be able to look at it then. It’s so valuable.’‘I know it’s valuable and that’s why I’ve given it to you. Otherwise it will only fallinto the hands of the junk-dealers.’‘But, Miss ...’‘Don’t argue. Besides, I may not be here next year.’‘Are you going away?’‘I’m not sure. I may go to England.’She had no intention of going to England; she had not seen the country since shewas a child, and she knew she would not fit in with the life of post-war Britain. Herhome was in these hills, among the oaks and maples and deodars. It was lonely, butat her age it would be lonely anywhere.The boy tucked the book under his arm, straightened his tie, stood stiffly toattention, and said, ‘Goodbye, Miss. Mackenzie.’It was the first time he had spoken her name.Winter set in early, and strong winds brought rain and sleet, and soon there wereno flowers in the garden or on the hillside. The cat stayed indoor, curled up at thefoot of Miss. Mackenzie’s bed.Miss. Mackenzie wrapped herself up in all her old shawls and mufflers, but stillshe felt the cold. Her fingers grew so stiff that she took almost an hour to open a canof baked beans. And then, it snowed, and for several days the milkman did not come.The postman arrived with her pension papers, but she felt too tired to take them upto town to the bank.She spent most of the time in bed. It was the warmest place. She kept a hot waterbottle at her back, and the cat kept her feet warm. She lay in bed, dreaming of thespring and summer months. In three months’ time the Primroses would be out andwith the coming of spring the boy would return.One night the hot water bottle burst and the bedding was soaked through. As therewas no sun for several days, the blanket remained damp. Miss. Mackenzie caught achill and had to keep to her cold, uncomfortable bed. She knew she had a fever but there was no thermometer with which to take her temperature. She had difficulty inbreathing.A strong wind sprang up one night, and the window flew open and kept bangingall night. Miss. Mackenzie was too weak to get up and close it, and the wind sweptthe rain and sleet into the room. The cat crept into the bed and snuggled close to itsmistress’s warm body. But towards morning that body had lost its warmth and thecat left the bed and started scratching about on the floor.As a shaft of sunlight streamed through the open window, the milkman arrived.He poured some milk into the cat’s saucer on the doorstep and the cat leapt downfrom the window-sill and made for the milk.The milkman called a greeting to Miss. Mackenzie, but received no answer. Herwindow was open and he had always known her to be up before sunrise. So he puthis head in at the window and called again. But Miss. Mackenzie did not answer. Shehad gone away to the mountain where the blue gentian and purple columbine grew. 	Aakanksha	2017		RH
17	A Case for Inspector Lal	I met Inspector Keemat Lal about two years ago, while I was living in the hot,dusty town of Shahpur in the plains of northern India.Keemat Lal had charge of the local police station. He was a heavily built man,slow and rather ponderous, and inclined to be lazy; but, like most lazy people, hewas intelligent. He was also a failure. He had remained an Inspector for a number ofyears, and had given up all hope of further promotion. His luck was against him, hesaid. He should never have been a policeman. He had been born under the sign ofCapricorn and should really have gone into the restaurant business; but now it wastoo late to do anything about it.The Inspector and I had little in common. He was nearing forty, and I was twenty-five. But both of us spoke English, and in Shahpur there were very few people whodid. In addition, we were both fond of beer. There were no places of entertainmentin Shahpur. The searing heat, the dust that came whirling up from the east, themosquitoes (almost as numerous as the flies), and the general monotony gave one athirst for something more substantial than stale lemonade.My house was on the outskirts of the town, where we were not often disturbed. Ontwo or three evenings in the week, just as the sun was going down and making itpossible for one to emerge from the khas-cooled confines of a dark, high-ceilingedbedroom, Inspector Keemat Lal would appear on the verandah steps, mopping thesweat from his face with a small towel, which he used instead of a handkerchief. Myonly servant, excited at the prospect of serving an Inspector of Police, would hurryout with glasses, a bucket of ice and several bottles of the best Indian beer.One evening, after we had overtaken our fourth bottle, I said, ‘You must have hadsome interesting cases in your career, Inspector.’‘Most of them were rather dull,’ he said. ‘At least the successful ones were. Thesensational cases usually went unsolved — otherwise I might have been aSuperintendent by now. I suppose you are talking of murder cases. Do youremember the shooting of the Minister of the Interior? I was on that one, but it was apolitical murder and we never solved it.’‘Tell me about a case you solved,’ I said. ‘An interesting one.’ When I saw himlooking uncomfortable, I added, ‘You don’t have to worry, Inspector. I’m a verydiscreet person, in spite of all the beer I consume.’‘But how can you be discreet? You are a writer.’I protested: ‘Writers are usually very discreet. They always change the names ofpeople and places.’He gave me one of his rare smiles. ‘And how would you describe me, if you wereto put me into a story?’‘Oh, I’d leave you as you are. No one would believe in you, anyway.’He laughed indulgently and poured out more beer. ‘I suppose I can change names,too ... I will tell you of a very interesting case. The victim was an unusual person,and so was the killer. But you must promise not to write this story.’‘I promise,’ I lied.‘Do you know Panauli?’‘In the hills? Yes, I have been there once or twice.’‘Good, then you will follow me without my having to be too descriptive. Thishappened about three years ago, shortly after I had been stationed at Panauli.Nothing much ever happened there. There were a few cases of theft and cheating,and an occasional fight during the summer. A murder took place about once everyten years. It was therefore quite an event when the Rani of—was found dead in hersitting-room, her head split open by an axe. I knew that I would have to solve thecase if I wanted to stay in Panauli.’‘The trouble was, anyone could have killed the Rani, and there were some whomade no secret of their satisfaction that she was dead. She had been an unpopularwoman. Her husband was dead, her children were scattered, and her money — forshe had never been a very wealthy Rani — had been dwindling away. She livedalone in an old house on the outskirts of the town, ruling the locality with the sternauthority of a matriarch. She had a servant, and he was the man who found the bodyand came to the police, dithering and tongue-tied. I arrested him at once, of course. Iknew he was probably innocent, but a basic rule is to grab the first man on the sceneof the crime, especially if he happens to be a servant. But we let him go after abeating. There was nothing much he could tell us, and he had a sound alibi.’‘The axe with which the Rani had been killed must have been a smallwoodcutter’s axe — so we deduced from the wound. We couldn’t find the weapon. It might have been used by a man or a woman, and there were several of both sexeswho had a grudge against the Rani. There were bazaar rumours that she had beensupplementing her income by trafficking in young women: she had the necessaryconnections. There were also rumours that she possessed vast wealth, and that it wasstored away in her godowns. We did not find any treasure. There were so manyrumours darting about like battered shuttlecocks that I decided to stop wasting mytime in trying to follow them up. Instead I restricted my enquiries to those peoplewho had been close to the Rani — either in their personal relationships or in actualphysical proximity.’‘To begin with, there was Mr. Kapur, a wealthy businessman from Bombay whohad a house in Panauli. He was supposed to be an old admirer of the Rani’s. Idiscovered that he had occasionally lent her money, and that, in spite of hisprofessed friendship for her, he had charged a high rate of interest.’‘Then there were her immediate neighbours — an American missionary and hiswife, who had been trying to convert the Rani to Christianity; an English spinster ofseventy who made no secret of the fact that she and the Rani had hated each otherwith great enthusiasm; a local councillor and his family, who did not get on wellwith their aristocratic neighbour; and a tailor, who kept his shop close by. None ofthese people had any powerful motive for killing the Rani — or none that I coulddiscover. But the tailor’s daughter interested me.’‘Her name was Kusum. She was twelve or thirteen years old — a thin dark girl,with lovely black eyes and a swift, disarming smile. While I was making my routineenquiries in the vicinity of the Rani’s house, I noticed that the girl always tried toavoid me. When I questioned her about the Rani, and about her own movements onthe day of the crime, she pretended to be very vague and stupid.’‘But I could see she was not stupid, and I became convinced that she knewsomething unusual about the Rani. She might even know something about themurder. She could have been protecting someone, and was afraid to tell me what sheknew. Often, when I spoke to her of the violence of the Rani’s death, I saw fear inher eyes. I began to think the girl’s life might be in danger, and I had a close watchkept on her. I liked her. I liked her youth and freshness. and the innocence andwonder in her eyes. I spoke to her whenever I could, kindly and paternally, andthough I knew she rather liked me and found me amusing — the ups and downs ofPanauli always left me panting for breath — and though I could see that she wantedto tell me something, she always held back at the last moment.’ ‘Then, one afternoon while I was in the Rani’s house going through her effects, Isaw something glistening in a narrow crack near the door-step. I would not havenoticed it if the sun had not been pouring through the window, glinting off the littleobject. I stooped and picked up a piece of glass. It was part of a broken bangle.’‘I turned the fragment over in my hand. There was something familiar about itscolour and design. Didn’t Kusum wear similar glass bangles? I went to look for thegirl but she was not at her father’s shop. I was told that she had gone down the hill,to gather firewood.’‘I decided to take the narrow path down the hill. It went round some rocks andcactus, and then disappeared into a forest of oak trees. I found Kusum sitting at theedge of the forest, a bundle of twigs beside her.’‘You are always wandering about alone,’ I said. ‘Don’t you feel afraid?’‘It is safer when I am alone,’ she replied. ‘Nobody comes here.’‘I glanced quickly at the bangles on her wrist, and noticed that their colourmatched that of broken piece. I held out the bit of broken glass and said, ‘I found itin the Rani’s house. It must have fallen ...’‘She did not wait for me to finish what I was saying. With a look of terror, shesprang up from the grass and fled into the forest.’‘I was completely taken aback. I had not expected such a reaction. Of whatsignificance was the broken bangle? I hurried after the girl, slipping on the smoothpine needles that covered the slopes. I was searching amongst the trees when I heardsomeone sobbing behind me. When I turned round, I saw the girl standing on aboulder, facing me with an axe in her hands.’‘When Kusum saw me staring at her, she raised the axe and rushed down the slopetowards me.’‘I was too bewildered to be able to do anything but stare with open mouth as sherushed at me with the axe. The impetus of her run would have brought her right upagainst me, and the axe, coming down, would probably have crushed my skull, thickthough it is. But while she was still six feet from me, the axe flew out of her hands. Itsprang into the air as though it had a life of its own and came curving towards me.’‘In spite of my weight, I moved swiftly aside. The axe grazed my shoulder andsank into the soft bark of the tree behind me. And Kusum dropped at my feet,weeping hysterically.’Inspector Keemat Lal paused in order to replenish his glass. He took a long pullat the beer, and the froth glistened on his moustache.‘And then what happened?’ I prompted him.‘Perhaps it could only have happened in India — and to a person like me,’ he said.‘This sudden compassion for the person you are supposed to destroy. Instead ofbeing furious and outraged, instead of seizing the girl and marching her off to thepolice station, I stroked her head and said silly comforting things.’‘And she told you that she had killed the Rani?’‘She told me how the Rani had called her to her house and given her tea andsweets. Mr. Kapur had been there. After some time he began stroking Kusum’s armsand squeezing her knees. She had drawn away, but Kapur kept pawing her. The Raniwas telling Kusum not to be afraid, that no harm would come to her. Kusum slippedaway from the man and made a rush for the door. The Rani caught her by theshoulders and pushed her back into the room. The Rani was getting angry. Kusumsaw the axe lying in a corner of the room. She seized it, raised it above her head andthreatened Kapur. The man realised that he had gone too far, and, valuing his neck,backed away. But the Rani, in a great rage, sprang at the girl. And Kusum, indesperation and panic, brought the axe down across the Rani’s head.’‘The Rani fell to the ground. Without waiting to see what Kapur might do, Kusumfled from the house. Her bangle must have broken when she stumbled against thedoor. She ran into the forest and, after concealing the axe amongst some tall ferns,lay weeping on the grass until it grew dark. But such was her nature, and such theresilience of youth, that she recovered sufficiently to be able to return home lookingher normal self. And during the following days she managed to remain silent aboutthe whole business.’‘What did you do about it?’ I asked.Keemat lal looked me straight in my berry eye.‘Nothing,’ he said. ‘I did absolutely nothing. I couldn’t have the girl put away in aremand home. It would have crushed her spirit.’‘And what about Kapur?’‘Oh, he had his own reasons for remaining quiet, as you may guess. No, the casewas closed — or perhaps I should say the file was put in my pending tray. Mypromotion, too, went into the pending tray.’‘It didn’t turn out very well for you,’ I said.‘No. Here I am in Shahpur, and still an Inspector. But, tell me, what would youhave done if you had been in my place?’I considered his question carefully for a moment or two, then said, ‘I suppose itwould have depended on how much sympathy the girl evoked in me. She had killedin innocence ...’‘Then you would have put your personal feelings above your duty to uphold thelaw?’‘Yes. But I would not have made a very good policeman.’‘Exactly.’‘Still, it’s a pity that Kapur got off so easily.’‘There was no alternative if I was to let the girl go. But he didn’t get offaltogether. He found himself in trouble later on for swindling some manufacturingconcern, and went to jail for a couple of years.’‘And the girl — did you see her again?’‘Well, before I was transferred from Panauli, I saw her occasionally on the road.She was usually on her way to school. She would greet me with joined palms, andcall me Uncle.’The beer bottles were all empty, and Inspector Keemat Lal got up to leave. Hisfinal words to me were, ‘I should never have been a policeman.’ 	Aakanksha	2017		RH
18	A Face in the Night	It may give you some idea of rural humour if I begin this tale with an anecdote thatconcerns me. I was walking alone through a village at night when I met an old mancarrying a lantern. I found, to my surprise, that the man was blind. ‘Old man,’ Iasked, ‘if you cannot see, why do you carry a lantern?’‘I carry this,’ he replied, ‘so that fools do not stumble against me in the dark.’This incident has only a slight connection with the story that follows, but I think itprovides the right sort of tone and setting. Mr. Oliver, an Anglo-Indian teacher, wasreturning to his school late one night, on the outskirts of the hill station of Simla.The school was conducted on English public school lines and the boys, most ofthem from well-to-do Indian families, wore blazers, caps and ties. Life magazine, ina feature on India, had once called this school the ‘Eton of the East’. Mr. Oliver hadbeen teaching in the school for several years. (He is no longer there). The Simlabazaar, with its cinemas and restaurants, was about two miles from the school; andMr. Oliver, a bachelor, usually strolled into the town in the evening, returning afterdark, when he would take a short cut through a pine forest.When there was a strong wind, the pine trees made sad, eerie sounds that keptmost people to the main road. But Mr. Oliver was not a nervous or imaginative man.He carried a torch and, on the night I write of, its pale gleam — the batteries wererunning down — moved fitfully over the narrow forest path. When its flickeringlight fell on the figure of a boy, who was sitting alone on a rock, Mr. Oliverstopped. Boys were not supposed to be out of school after 7 p.m., and it was nowwell past nine.‘What are you doing out here, boy?’ asked Mr. Oliver sharply, moving closer sothat he could recognise the miscreant. But even as he approached the boy, Mr. Oliversensed that something was wrong. The boy appeared to be crying. His head hungdown, he held his face in his hands, and his body shook convulsively. It was astrange, soundless weeping, and Mr. Oliver felt distinctly uneasy.‘Well — what’s the matter?’ he asked, his anger giving way to concern. ‘What areyou crying for?’ The boy would not answer or look up. His body continued to beracked with silent sobbing. Come on, boy, you shouldn’t be out here at this hour.Tell me the trouble. Look up!’ The boy looked up. He took his hands from his faceand looked up at his teacher. The light from Mr. Oliver’s torch fell on the boy’s face— if you could call it a face.He had no eyes, ears, nose or mouth. It was just a round smooth head — with aschool cap on top of it. And that’s where the story should end — as indeed it has, forseveral people who have had similar experiences and dropped dead of inexplicableheart attacks But for Mr. Oliver it did not end there.The torch fell from his trembling hand. He turned and scrambled down the path,running blindly through the trees and calling for help. He was still running towardsthe school buildings when he saw a lantern swinging in the middle of the path. Mr.Oliver had never before been so pleased to see the night-watchman. He stumbled upthe watchman, gasping for breath and speaking incoherently. ‘What is it, Sahib?’asked the watchman. ‘Has there been an accident? Why are you running?’‘I saw something — something horrible — a boy weeping in the forest — and hehad no face!’ ‘No face, Sahib?’ ‘No eyes, nose, mouth — nothing.’ ‘Do you mean itwas like this, Sahib?’ asked the watchman, and raised the lamp to his own face. Thewatchman had no eyes, no ears, no features at all — not even an eyebrow! The windblew the lamp out, and Mr. Oliver had his heart attack. 	Aakanksha	2017		RH
19	A Job Well done	Dhuki, the gardener, was clearing up the weeds that grew in profusion around theold disused well. He was an old man, skinny and bent and spindly-legged; but he hadalways been like that; his strength lay in his wrists and in his long, tendril-likefingers. He looked as frail as a petunia, but he had the tenacity of a vine.‘Are you going to cover the well?’ I asked. I was eight, a great favourite of Dhuki.He had been the gardener long before my birth; had worked for my father, until myfather died, and now worked for my mother and step-father.‘I must cover it, I suppose,’ said Dhuki. ‘That’s what the “Major sahib” wants.He’ll be back any day, and if he finds the well still uncoverd he’ll get into one of hisraging fits and I’ll be looking for another job!’The ‘Major sahib’ was my step-father, Major Summerskill. A tall, hearty, back-slapping man, who liked polo and pig-sticking. He was quite unlike my father. Myfather had always given me books to read. The Major said I would become adreamer if I read too much, and took the books away. I hated him; and did not thinkmuch of my mother for marrying him.‘The boy’s too soft,’ I heard him tell my mother. ‘I must see that he gets ridinglessons.’But, before the riding lessons could be arranged, the Major’s regiment wasordered to Peshawar. Trouble was expected from some of the frontier tribes. He wasaway for about two months. Before leaving, he had left strict instructions for Dhukito cover up the old well.‘Too damned dangerous having an open well in the middle of the garden,’ mystep-father had said. ‘Make sure that it’s completely covered by the time I get back.’Dhuki was loth to cover up the old well. It had been there for over 50 years, longbefore the house had been built. In its walls lived a colony of pigeons. Their softcooing filled the garden with a lovely sound. And during the hot, dry, summermonths, when taps ran dry, the well was always a dependable source of water. The bhisti still used it, filling his goatskin bag with the cool clear water and sprinklingthe paths around the house to keep the dust down.Dhuki pleaded with my mother to let him leave the well uncovered.‘What will happen to the pigeons?’ he asked.‘Oh, surely they can find another well,’ said my mother. ‘Do close it up soon,Dhuki. I don’t want the Sahib to come back and find that you haven’t done anythingabout it.’My mother seemed just a little bit afraid of the Major. How can we be afraid ofthose we love? It was a question that puzzled me then, and puzzles me still.The Major’s absence made life pleasant again. I returned to my books, spent longhours in my favourite banyan tree, ate buckets of mangoes, and dawdled in thegarden talking to Dhuki.Neither he nor I were looking forward to the Major’s return. Dhuki had stayed onafter my mother’s second marriage only out of loyalty to her and affection for me;he had really been my father’s man. But my mother had always appeared deceptivelyfrail and helpless, and most men, Major Summerskill included, felt protectivetowards her. She liked people who did things for her.‘Your father liked this well,’ said Dhuki. ‘He would often sit here in the evenings,with a book in which he made drawings of birds and flowers and insects.’I remembered those drawings, and I remembered how they had all been thrownaway by the Major when he had moved into the house. Dhuki knew about it too. Ididn’t keep much from him.‘It’s a sad business closing this well,’ said Dhuki again. ‘Only a fool or adrunkard is likely to fall into it.’But he had made his preparations. Planks of sal wood, bricks and cement wereneatly piled up around the well.‘Tomorrow,’ said Dhuki. Tomorrow I will do it. Not today. Let the birds remainfor one more day. In the morning, baba, you can help me drive the birds from thewell.’On the day my step-father was expected back, my mother hired a tonga and wentto the bazaar to do some shopping. Only a few people had cars in those days. Evencolonels went about in tongas. Now, a clerk finds it beneath his dignity to sit in one.As the Major was not expected before evening, I decided I would make full use ofmy last free morning, I took all my favourite books and stored them away in anouthouse, where I could come for them from time to time. Then, my pockets bursting with mangoes, I climbed into the banyan tree. It was the darkest and coolestplace on a hot day in June.From behind the screen of leaves that concealed me, I could see Dhuki movingabout near the well. He appeared to be most unwilling to get on with the job ofcovering it up.‘Baba!’ he called, several times; but I did not feel like stirring from the banyantree. Dhuki grasped a long plank of wood and placed it across one end of the well.He started hammering. From my vantage point in the banyan tree, he looked verybent and old.A jingle of tonga bells and the squeak of unoiled wheels told me that a tonga wascoming in at the gate. It was too early for my mother to be back. I peered throughthe thick, waxy leaves of the tree, and nearly fell off my branch in surprise. It wasmy step-father, the Major! He had arrived earlier than expected.I did not come down from the tree. I had no intention of confronting my step-father until my mother returned.The Major had climbed down from the tonga and was watching his luggage beingcarried on to the verandah. He was red in the face and the ends of his handlebarmoustache were stiff with brilliantine. Dhuki approached with a half-hearted salaam.‘Ah, so there you are, you old scoundrel!’ exclaimed the Major, trying to soundfriendly and jocular. ‘More jungle than garden, from what I can see. You’re getingtoo old for this sort of work, Dhuki. Time to retire! And where’s the Memsahib?’‘Gone to the bazaar,’ said Dhuki.‘And the boy?’Dhuki shrugged. ‘I have not seen the boy, today, Sahib.’‘Damn!’ said the Major. ‘A fine homecoming, this. Well, wake up the cook-boyand tell him to get some sodas.’‘Cook-boy’s gone away,’ said Dhuki.‘Well, I’ll be double-damned,’ said the major.The tonga went away, and the Major started pacing up and down the garden path.Then he saw Dhuki’s unfinished work at the well. He grew purple in the face, strodeacross to the well, and started ranting at the old gardener.Dhuki began making excuses. He said something about a shortage of bricks; thesickness of a niece; unsatisfactory cement; unfavourable weather; unfavourablegods. When none of this seemed to satisfy the Major, Dhuki began mumbling aboutsomething bubbling up from the bottom of the well, and pointed down into its depths. The Major stepped on to the low parapet and looked down. Dhuki keptpointing. The Major leant over a little.Dhuki’s hand moved swiftly, like a conjurer’s making a pass. He did not actuallypush the Major. He appeared merely to tap him once on the bottom. I caught aglimpse of my step-father’s boots as he disappeared into the well. I couldn’t helpthinking of Alice in Wonderland, of Alice disappearing down the rabbit hole.There was a tremendous splash, and the pigeons flew up, circling the well thricebefore settling on the roof of the bungalow.By lunch time — or tiffin, as we called it then — Dhuki had the well covered overwith the wooden planks.‘The Major will be pleased,’ said my mother, when she came home. ‘It will bequite ready by evening, won’t it, Dhuki?’By evening, the well had been completely bricked over. It was the fastest bit ofwork Dhuki had ever done.Over the next few weeks, my mother’s concern changed to anxiety, her anxiety tomelancholy, and her melancholy to resignation. By being gay and high-spiritedmyself, I hope I did something to cheer her up. She had written to the Colonel of theRegiment, and had been informed that the Major had gone home on leave afortnight previously. Somewhere, in the vastness of India, the Major haddisappeared.It was easy enough to disappear and never be found. After several months hadpassed without the Major turning up, it was presumed that one of two things musthad happened. Either he had been murdered on the train, and his corpse flung into ariver; or, he had run away with a tribal girl and was living in some remote corner ofthe country.Life had to carry on for the rest of us. The rains were over, and the guava seasonwas approaching.My mother was receiving visits from a colonel of His Majesty’s 32nd Foot. Hewas an elderly, easy-going, seemingly absent-minded man, who didn’t get in theway at all, but left slabs of chocolate lying around the house.‘A good Sahib,’ observed Dhuki, as I stood beside him behind the bougainvillaea,watching the colonel saunter up the verandah steps. ‘See how well he wears his solatopee! It covers his head completely.’‘He’s bald underneath,’ I said.‘No matter. I think he will be all right.’‘And if he isn’t,’ I said, ‘we can always open up the well again.’ Dhuki dropped the nozzle of the hose pipe, and water gushed out over our feet.But he recovered quickly, and taking me by the hand, led me across to the old well,now surmounted by a three-tiered cement platform which looked rather like awedding cake.‘We must not forget our old well,’ he said. ‘Let us make it beautiful, baba. Someflower pots, perhaps.’And together we fetched pots, and decorated the covered well with ferns andgeraniums. Everyone congratulated Dhuki on the fine job he’d done. My only regretwas that the pigeons had gone away. 	Aakanksha	2017		RH
20	The Story of Madhu	I met little Madhu several years ago, when I lived alone in an obscure town near theHimalayan foothills. I was in my late twenties then, and my outlook on life was stillquite romantic; the cynicism that was to come with the thirties had not yet set in.I preferred the solitude of the small district town to the kind of social life I mighthave found in the cities; and in my books, my writing and the surrounding hills,there was enough for my pleasure and occupation.On summer mornings I would often sit beneath an old mango tree, with anotebook or a sketch pad on my knees. The house which I had rented (for a verynominal sum) stood on the outskirts of the town; and a large tank and a few poorhouses could be seen from the garden wall. A narrow public pathway passed underthe low wall.One morning, while I sat beneath the mango tree, I saw a young girl of aboutnine, wearing torn clothes, darting about on the pathway and along the high banks ofthe tank.Sometimes she stopped to look at me; and, when I showed that I noticed her, shefelt encouraged and gave me a shy, fleeting smile. The next day I discovered herleaning over the garden wall, following my actions as I paced up and down on thegrass.In a few days an acquaintance had been formed. I began to take the girl’s presencefor granted, and even to look for her; and she, in turn, would linger about on thepathway until she saw me come out of the house.One day, as she passed the gate, I called her to me.‘What is your name?’ I asked. ‘And where do you live?’‘Madhu,’ she said, brushing back her long untidy black hair and smiling at mefrom large black eyes. She pointed across the road: ‘I live with my grandmother.’‘Is she very old?’ I asked.Madhu nodded confidingly and whispered: ‘A hundred years ...’ ‘We will never be that old,’ I said. She was very slight and frail, like a flowergrowing in a rock, vulnerable to wind and rain.I discovered later that the old lady was not her grandmother but a childlesswoman who had found the baby girl on the banks of the tank. Madhu’s realparentage was unknown; but the wizened old woman had, out of compassion,brought up the child as her own.My gate once entered, Madhu included the garden in her circle of activities. Shewas there every morning, chasing butterflies, stalking squirrels and mynahs, hervoice brimming with laughter, her slight figure flitting about between the trees.Sometimes, but not often, I gave her a toy or a new dress; and one day she putaside her shyness and brought me a present of a nose-gay, made up of marigoldsand wild blue-cotton flowers.‘For you,’ she said, and put the flowers in my lap.‘They are very beautiful,’ I said, picking out the brightest marigold and putting itin her hair. ‘But they are not as beautiful as you.’More than a year passed before I began to take more than a mildly patronizinginterest in Madhu.It occurred to me after some time that she should be taught to read and write, and Iasked a local teacher to give her lessons in the garden for an hour every day. Sheclapped her hands with pleasure at the prospect of what was to be for her afascinating new game.In a few weeks Madhu was surprising us with her capacity for absorbingknowledge. She always came to me to repeat the lessons of the day, and pestered mewith questions on a variety of subjects. How big was the world? And were the starsreally like our world? Or were they the sons and daughters of the Sun and theMoon?My interest in Madhu deepened, and my life, so empty till then, became imbuedwith a new purpose. As she sat on the grass beside me, reading aloud, or listening tome with a look of complete trust and belief, all the love that had been lying dormantin me during my years of self-exile surfaced in a sudden surge of tenderness.Three years glided away imperceptibly, and at the age of 13 Madhu was on theverge of blossoming into a woman. I began to feel a certain responsibility towardsher.It was dangerous, I knew, to allow a child so pretty to live almost alone andunprotected, and to run unrestrained about the grounds. And in a censorious societyshe would be made to suffer if she spent too much time in my company. She could see no need for any separation; but I decided to send her to a missionschool in the next district, where I could visit her from time to time.‘But why?’ said Madhu. ‘I can learn more from you, and from the teacher whocomes. I am so happy here.’‘You will meet other girls and make many friends,’ I told her. ‘I will come to seeyou. And, when you come home, we will be even happier. It is good that you shouldgo.’It was the middle of June, a hot and oppressive month in the Siwaliks. Madhu hadexpressed her readiness to go to school, and when, one evening, I did not see her asusual in the garden, I thought nothing of it; but the next day I was informed that shehad fever and could not leave the house.Illness was something Madhu had not known before, and for this reason I feltafraid. I hurried down the path which led to the old woman’s cottage. It seemedstrange that I had never once entered it during my long friendship with Madhu.It was a humble mud hut, the ceiling just high enough to enable me to standupright, the room dark but clean. Madhu was lying on a string cot exhausted byfever, her eyes closed, her long hair unkempt, one small hand hanging over the side.It struck me then how little, during all this time, I had thought of her physicalcomforts. There was no chair; I knelt down, and took her hand in mine. I knew, fromthe fierce heat of her body, that she was seriously ill.She recognized my touch, and a smile passed across her face before she openedher eyes. She held on to my hand, then laid it across her cheek.I looked round the little room in which she had grown up. It had scarcely anarticle of furniture apart from two string cots, on one of which the old woman satand watched us, her white, wizened head nodding like a puppet’s.In a corner lay Madhu’s little treasures. I recognized among them the presentswhich during the past four years I had given her. She had kept everything. On herdark arm she still wore a small piece of ribbon which I had playfully tied thereabout a year ago. She had given her heart, even before she was conscious ofpossessing one, to a stranger unworthy of the gift.As the evening drew on, a gust of wind blew open the door of the dark room, anda gleam of sunshine streamed in, lighting up a portion of the wall. It was the timewhen every evening she would join me under the mango tree. She had been quiet foralmost an hour, and now a slight pressure of her hand drew my eyes back to herface.‘What will we do now?’ she said. ‘When will you send me to school?’ ‘Not for a long time. First you must get well and strong. That is all that matters.’She didn’t seem to hear me. I think she knew she was dying, but she did not resentits happening.‘Who will read to you under the tree?’ she went on. ‘Who will look after you?’she asked, with the solicitude of a grown woman.‘You will, Madhu. You are grown up now. There will be no one else to look afterme.’The old woman was standing at my shoulder. A hundred years — and little Madhuwas slipping away. The woman took Madhu’s hand from mine, and laid it gentlydown. I sat by the cot a little longer, and then I rose to go, all the loneliness in theworld pressing upon my heart. 	Aakanksha	2017		RH
